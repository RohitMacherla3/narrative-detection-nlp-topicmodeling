# narrative-detection-nlp-topicmodeling
This project aims to detect narrative spread across diverse platforms such as Emails, Podcasts, and TV. The techniques used for this project are LLM for obtaining the semantic meaning of the text data and DP-Means Clustering to identify different narratives.


## This week's Action Items:
1. Get the Amarel Cluster issue resolved - Resolved
2. Run the MPNet LLM and get embeddings at passages level - In progress (TV Remaining)
3. Try FAISS on K-Means - Completed
4. Try Link Transformer
5. Get the next Steps from the paper - Completed
6. Try BERTopic for Clustering - waiting for confirmation
7. Run the DP-Means Clustering and obtain results - on hold
