# narrative-detection-nlp-topicmodeling
This project aims to detect narrative spread across diverse platforms such as Emails, Podcasts, and TV. The techniques used for this project are LLM for obtaining the semantic meaning of the text data and DP-Means Clustering to identify different narratives.


## This week's Action Items:
1. Include date column for email data - Completed
2. Filter 2022 data only for 10 months - Completed
3. Convert text to passages using existing code with modifications -  Completed
4. Run the MPNet LLM and get embeddings at passages level - In progress (TV Remaining)
5. Run the DP-Means Clustering and obtain results - In Progress
