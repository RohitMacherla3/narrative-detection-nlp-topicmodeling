       "[\"And welcome back fellow American patriots and minimans standing at the ready to fight anew for our life, our liberty, and our property here at Sierra podcast on this fine Tuesday, September 13th. Daniel Horowitz back here in the house today. And folks, I was thinking has there ever been a revolution in global history where there was no opposition? It's like you're facing a revolution but you don't even know it. Where are the troops? Where's the cavalry? Where's everyone?\",\n",
       " 'Name me a single issue that is confronting us systemically, the transhumanism, the medical fascism, the war on food fuel, forcing us to eat bugs and drink sewage water, the border, crime, anything where there is a meaningful, coherent opposition that is likely to get into power and implement a plan or even is articulating a plan. I think back to 2010, the issues of the time were Obamacare and spending, and at least in word, there was a united front to fight them.',\n",
       " \"Now they lied about it, but you can at least lie to yourself and dupe yourself into saying, hey, I'll vote Republican in two months. And there's a likelihood that something will change. How could anyone look themselves in the mirror today, mid September and say, look, seven weeks from now, if I vote Republican, this and this will change.\",\n",
       " \"I challenge you to try to ascertain one issue that will change, one benefit we will see, one benefit that they're even promising to deliver on. See, they might just tag the Democrats with these broad strokes of all this too much crime, there's too much stuff, the border, too much inflation. That's basically their message. But they failed to tell you what they're going to do about it.\",\n",
       " \"And the reason they can't tell you that is because they were part of everything that caused it, which is broadly why the Democrats don't fear it. There's no deterrent. The Democrats fear no opposition. They feel no opposition. Put yourself in their shoes. What is stopping you from going all out? Well, it's unlawful. It's immoral. Oh, really? Has that stopped them? There is nothing they cannot do to violate legal norms, political norms, human rights standards.\",\n",
       " \"Because guess what? They already did that since March 2020. And Republicans don't even complain about it. Much less events a strong opposition, a strong image that could somehow deter them. So we're going to go through what Republicans are up to these days. And you're going to judge for yourself what that portends for the future, because I don't know what you do with that. Now, one thing you can do is work on parallel economies yourself.\",\n",
       " \"I mean, this is what we should we should have a plan in all the red states to actively build infrastructure independent from the communists left on every vital good and service. But for now, when it comes to your cell phone, okay, well, what are you going to use? Spy mobile, Verizon, AT&T? They're all the same. They spy on you. And the telecoms is actually probably in the top five of funding the Great Reset and promoting it.\",\n",
       " \"Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative mobile provider. They've been on the front lines fighting for your values rather than subverting them. And look, you know, typically, you have to sacrifice when you're moving away from you know, the big monopolies here, they use the same tower, same coverage. The only difference is when you call a customer service, which inevitably you have to do with a mobile plan, you actually get an English speaking American on the phone.\",\n",
       " \"So go to patriot mobile.com slash CR or call 972 Patriot. Use offer code CR to get free activation. If you're a veteran or first responder, please let them know because they actually support you rather than hate you. And we'll offer you a special discount. So again, join our movement today and make the switch away from the cartel. Join parallel economies with Patriot Mobile. It's patriot mobile.com slash CR or call 972 Patriot.\",\n",
       " \"So folks today everyone is yelping about inflation because the CPI came out today. And like, look at that Democrats, you said you promised to lower inflation so much for that so much for build back better. It's not any better. Prices are up so much for the Inflation Reduction Act. Like what you fools. They're debating the Democrats as if this were the 1980s or something. Like we have a intellectual debate over how to best deal with inflation. And you guys are wrong.\",\n",
       " \"We have a better plan. No, they believe in it. They want it. They arsoned it. That is the point. They don't want reduction in prices because they want you eating bugs and walking instead of driving and living in. I don't know if you've ever seen these simulations where they have these mock cities they want to build that are a couple hundred feet wide and long where everyone's living in some sort of transhuman utopia. That's what they want.\",\n",
       " \"And they're achieving it. And they're achieving it because the same Republicans that just use these feeble talking points a couple of weeks before an election to militate and they against some of the worst symptoms of what they helped cause. They fail to realize that they mean business and Republicans help them get to this point. It's pathetic. You know, it's interesting. Republicans will only fight.\",\n",
       " \"I noticed the only issue they seem to care about is the student loan thing of all things that have happened to us. They've killed millions with the lockdowns and the shots and the creation of virus and the more more stuff they plan on creating. You cannot even go anywhere to get normal treatment for anything. Health care is destroyed. Food they're in the process of destroying. Fuel everything. We need to interpose against the tyranny.\",\n",
       " \"You have the FBI now going after anyone who just espouses the political views of Trump and they're roping them in, subpoenaing them. And obviously of crime the border. They might indulge it as a talking point here and there. But the only thing they get all excited about. So one of the things I keep mentioning is that governors need to get together and form an alliance and say this and this doesn't happen in the state. FBI, IRS don't violate human rights.\",\n",
       " \"We're going to work together to build our parallel economies to secure food and fuel supply chains and infrastructure, medical freedom. It's going to be a constitutional sanctuary zone. No. The one thing I think pretty much every GOP governor signed this, they signed a letter complaining about the canceling of $10,000 worth of student loan. Again, I don't disagree with what they're saying, but it's just funny how that's the one thing they understand.\",\n",
       " \"But they don't really understand it because again, why are student loans out of control? Because tuition is out of control. Why is tuition out of control? Because Republicans joined the Democrats for several decades in funding the subsidizing the cartel. The same way they complain about inflation and they caused it. By the way, what I wanted to say for today is that even though gas prices are down a lot, inflation is worse than ever, particularly with food.\",\n",
       " \"I mentioned this throughout the last couple of months. Gas prices are a straw man. None of us like it when it's high, but the truth be told, you're paying a couple hundred dollars more if you travel a lot, maybe $1,000, $2,000 more. That hurts, but what's even more is everything else. What this demonstrates is it's not just because of the gas supply. There's inherent inflation across the board. Why is that?\",\n",
       " \"That is because of the trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary pumping that Republicans have supported for decades and culminating with the COVID craziness. They literally tried to call up Thomas Massey, even the conservative ones to convince him not to call for a recorded vote that day, March 27th, 2020. So almost everyone not named Thomas Massey is responsible for it. But it's funny how Republicans won't even realize the cause of the issue.\",\n",
       " \"They don't understand the magnitude of it, where it's coming from and where it's headed, frankly, because they're a part of it. And again, that is why the bad guys neither feel nor fear any deterrent, which is why they now openly call their shots. If you notice, they will openly admit, oh, I don't know why we're doing this, but shut up. We're doing it anyway.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, the shots don't work, but that's why you need a booster. We're going to do this anyway. They admit it. They admit that their policies serve no logical purpose other than the purpose we know it serves, which is control. But they know they don't need to even intellectually defend it because nobody's going to hold them accountable.\",\n",
       " \"You might have one or two people poke at them, an elected official, an outside commentator, but you don't have a critical mass movement that has power. And the reason you don't is because it was done that way by design to have this controlled opposition. And I want to show you a perfect example of this. But first, our final sponsor today, Policy Genius, it's not an insurance company, but they aggregate for you online.\",\n",
       " \"So in a couple minutes, you just put in your information and they will show apples to apples comparison of the best quotes for life insurance. Those of you who roll your eyes at life insurance just understand that most people do not get enough coverage through their job. You usually need about 10 times more, especially if you, you know, you're like me, you got a family of four kids.\",\n",
       " \"And I don't mean to be rude, but I mean, especially if you got the shots, you better be looking at this because with an 84% increase in life insurance claims for the middle age brackets because of sudden adult death syndrome, AKA mRNA genocide, those rates are going to be going up. So you should go to policygenius.com slash Daniel and do your shopping right now.\",\n",
       " \"You could save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius and more than just a website, they actually have a team of licensed experts. So you could call their hotline to better understand the options that are laid out for you and apply for a policy with them. And again, they're not a company that sells insurance. They work for you, not the insurance companies. And so you could trust their unbiased help and advocacy. They don't add extra fees.\",\n",
       " \"They don't sell your info to third parties. Since 2014, Policy Genius has helped over 30 million people shop for insurance. They placed 120 billion in coverage. So head over to policygenius.com slash Daniel to get your free life insurance quotes and see how much you could save before that window of opportunity closes.\",\n",
       " \"By the way, with that window of opportunity closing, I mentioned yesterday and I have a column out today, this New England Journal of Medicine study that shows that those who got the shots, even though they already had the virus, wound up having less protection than those who didn't get the shots and never had the virus. Because the shots not only make it more likely that you get the virus, but it erases your natural immunity. So I mentioned that yesterday.\",\n",
       " \"But amazingly, if you look at the conclusion of that study, they say, therefore you need boosters. See, this is what they do. They're like, yeah, this is going to kill you. You know, you've never heard these pharmaceutical ads. There's like 30 seconds worth of disclaimers. This might cause brain bleeds and heart attacks and strokes and diabetes. But make sure you pick up your pack at the pharmacy nearby. It's like, what? What did you just say?\",\n",
       " \"How does like one plus five equals 27? It's like, yeah, this thing erases your natural immunity. That's why you can't rely on it. And that's why you need to constantly get more of it. And they get away with it openly. So with that, I want to play here. An amazing clip, you might have heard it. It was going around the internet last week.\",\n",
       " \"There's this Australian senator, Senator Pauline Hanson, during a floor debate in their parliament, asked Penny Wong, who's the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on net zero, just to define for us what net zero is. And we all know what it is. It means that you choke off all so-called carbon, which basically means you have no food and fuel, which is exactly what they want.\",\n",
       " \"Hence, walking around naked like cavemen, eating bugs and sewage water and, you know, nothing that actually works to enhance your life. So she asked her what it is. Just define for us what it is. Take a listen to this unbelievable clip. Would the minister please explain to the Australian people and I what net zero emissions actually means in layman's terms? Thank you, Senator Hanson. Minister. I'm not sure how to explain it other than to say it means net zero.\",\n",
       " \"I mean, you know, and I understand that the senator, it's one of those situations I will think through if I can provide an explanation to make it clearer than that. But to me, the words net zero are quite clear. I think we all understand what net emissions means. I am reminded of a time when I was climate minister and I think Senator Fielding wanted an explanation and I got in the chief scientist to try and take him through it.\",\n",

They say the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa founded in 2006 with money from the Gates and Rockefeller foundations has produced has promoted an industrial mode of agricultural that poisons soils with chemicals and encourages farmers to go into debt by buying expensive seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.',\n",
       " \"As a result of that debt, some farmers had to sell their land or household goods like stoves and TVs. And that's where they could have stood up for black people. But of course they don't. Because as Kevin Stitt said, it's all about where the investments are headed. And by the way, so we're going to go through our transhumanism update. Speaking of fertilizer and what they're doing, they're doing this everywhere now.\",\n",
       " \"UN food official warns fertilizer affordability crisis could slash global grain production by 40%. Again, why at a time like this would you cut off Russia, which produces all the fertilizer? The answer is because you know that's the key to shutting off food productivity. Maximo Torero, the chief economist from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, told Bloomberg that elevated fertilizer prices could decrease global grain production by upwards of 40%. Do you understand how serious that is?\",\n",
       " \"This is from the African Development Bank. We are really starting to yell from every tower that there's a fertilizer crisis. This is real. And what's their plan? And by the way, someone put this out and I want to give credit but I forgot where it's from. It's on the USDA's website. They have a press release. USDA opens People's Garden Initiative to gardens nationwide. This is released September 9.\",\n",
       " \"Now, what would be the solution to all of this is to become self-reliant, right? To have your own victory garden. They have a People's Garden Initiative. Do you know what that initiative is? Basically, you could register on the USDA website and if you meet criteria, including benefiting the community, you could be part of their program. Their affiliate People's Garden locations will be featured on a map on the USDA website. And they have a whole registration program.\",\n",
       " \"You know what this is about. So they could identify who has their own gardens and target it and destroy it. It's obvious as day why they would put that out suddenly. So that's on the food front. What about on the digital front? This is from Tyler Durden. China creates digital twin of Americans, former DoD cybersecurity expert says.\",\n",
       " \"As reports have emerged that Chinese military-linked firms gather American DNA, these firms are now capable of creating digital replicas of Americans, according to John Mills, former director of cybersecurity policy strategy and international affairs at DoD. They have the capacity to create these complex models of each of us. They're making digital twins of us. Digital twins. And our government is responsible for that.\",\n",
       " 'Our government worked with China to allow China access to everything that they can now literally have a replica of every American and know exactly what needs to happen. And guess what that is? The biggest thing is medical records. They can get our medical records. They could know how to create viruses that target specific ethnicities, DNA. Everything, my friends, is on the table. What else? This is from Peter Sweden. His substack, schools are now feeding bugs to children.',\n",
       " \"It's not a joke anymore. A thousand schools in Australia have started offering children chips containing basically like cricket powder. Where's that coming from? This is from the Daily Telegraph. Chips are coming from the Daily Telegraph. Chips are great, aren't they? And these chips are even better because I think they're better for you. Do you know? Did you know that? Yeah. That way, you know, mom and dad might let you have more chips. Good stuff.\",\n",
       " \"Children at four primary schools age five to 11 in Wales were offering insects to eat as part of a project to see how children's appetites are for alternative protein, alternative protein. Think of that term. Think of that term. There's a reason why it's all over the Bible that eating bugs and creepy crawlers is an abomination. And that's where we're headed. And then what are they going to do with all this control? Now we'll go on to banking.\",\n",
       " \"So again, we have it everything. The FBI, big tech, big banking all collaborate to censor us. The bank sponsor drag shows and track everything and then eventually cut off credit. And credit card companies join forces with the left to flag gun sales. And we're still saying, oh, it's private enterprise. This is from AmmoLand.com. UPS threatens to cancel service for most of the gun industry.\",\n",
       " \"They're requiring online sellers to ship an average of 50 handguns daily, ones that ship 50 daily to use its second day air service. Sellers who do not ship at least 350 handguns a week risk losing their shipping accounts under the new agreement. UPS is only required to give customers a 10 day notice before cutting them off from shipping service. And this was just sent to arms dealers. Okay, there's no doubt it's coming from the ATF.\",\n",
       " \"But what they do is they funnel it through the private sector. Again, we need this is what we need in the red states. Anti-discrimination laws, if we're going to have them, they need to be applied evenly. And the lesson the question that needs to be asked about all this ESG stuff, whether it's banking, whether it's PayPal, whether it's anything, what would happen if they would do it to the homosexual agenda?\",\n",
       " \"And whatever that answer is, needs to apply to us. You want to abolish anti-discrimination laws, we could have that conversation. But if we're going to have them, we will apply them evenly. That is the discussion that needs to take place in red states. Oh, a private business could do what they want. No, this is all done, as we've well learned at the BS the government. But the point is, this is just a smattering of our latest transhuman agenda.\",\n",
       " \"When I say transhumanism, I mean, their desire to literally shut down our humanity, our life, our liberty, our property, our physical being surveil us, control us, treat us like Lego toys, destroy our food, fuel, medicine. We had a rhino rampage update and a transhumanism update. And it's very profound, because one demonstrates the severity of what we're up against and the other demonstrates that the opposition that has been tapped to represent us in combating that is literally in on it.\",\n",
       " \"As Kevin Stitt, one of the most conservative governor said, Governor said, that's where the investments are. So again, it's not only that they're going to be a weak opposition. No, if you know that that's where the money and investments are, you're going to be a strong proponent for in favor of what they're doing. Because that's where the money is.\",\n",
       " \"And until we as a movement, recognize what we have laid out today, we will never, ever even embark on rectifying these problems, because we're married to those that are inducing it. And folks, that's just the way it is for today. We will try to get on some more guests later this week. Again, give us a five star rating on iTunes is always with a comment. It certainly does help. I appreciate it. Email me Daniel Hurwitz at startmail.com.\",\n",
       " \"You can follow me on Twitter at C 19 truth bombs. I'm sorry, not Twitter. I'm kicked off Twitter telegram at C 19 truth bombs till tomorrow. God bless y'all and thank you for listening.\"]"
