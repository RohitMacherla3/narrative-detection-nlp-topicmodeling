       "[\"And welcome back fellow American patriots and minimans standing at the ready to fight anew for our life, our liberty, and our property here at Sierra podcast on this fine Tuesday, September 13th. Daniel Horowitz back here in the house today. And folks, I was thinking has there ever been a revolution in global history where there was no opposition? It's like you're facing a revolution but you don't even know it. Where are the troops? Where's the cavalry? Where's everyone?\",\n",
       " 'Name me a single issue that is confronting us systemically, the transhumanism, the medical fascism, the war on food fuel, forcing us to eat bugs and drink sewage water, the border, crime, anything where there is a meaningful, coherent opposition that is likely to get into power and implement a plan or even is articulating a plan. I think back to 2010, the issues of the time were Obamacare and spending, and at least in word, there was a united front to fight them.',\n",
       " \"Now they lied about it, but you can at least lie to yourself and dupe yourself into saying, hey, I'll vote Republican in two months. And there's a likelihood that something will change. How could anyone look themselves in the mirror today, mid September and say, look, seven weeks from now, if I vote Republican, this and this will change.\",\n",
       " \"I challenge you to try to ascertain one issue that will change, one benefit we will see, one benefit that they're even promising to deliver on. See, they might just tag the Democrats with these broad strokes of all this too much crime, there's too much stuff, the border, too much inflation. That's basically their message. But they failed to tell you what they're going to do about it.\",\n",
       " \"And the reason they can't tell you that is because they were part of everything that caused it, which is broadly why the Democrats don't fear it. There's no deterrent. The Democrats fear no opposition. They feel no opposition. Put yourself in their shoes. What is stopping you from going all out? Well, it's unlawful. It's immoral. Oh, really? Has that stopped them? There is nothing they cannot do to violate legal norms, political norms, human rights standards.\",\n",
       " \"Because guess what? They already did that since March 2020. And Republicans don't even complain about it. Much less events a strong opposition, a strong image that could somehow deter them. So we're going to go through what Republicans are up to these days. And you're going to judge for yourself what that portends for the future, because I don't know what you do with that. Now, one thing you can do is work on parallel economies yourself.\",\n",
       " \"I mean, this is what we should we should have a plan in all the red states to actively build infrastructure independent from the communists left on every vital good and service. But for now, when it comes to your cell phone, okay, well, what are you going to use? Spy mobile, Verizon, AT&T? They're all the same. They spy on you. And the telecoms is actually probably in the top five of funding the Great Reset and promoting it.\",\n",
       " \"Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative mobile provider. They've been on the front lines fighting for your values rather than subverting them. And look, you know, typically, you have to sacrifice when you're moving away from you know, the big monopolies here, they use the same tower, same coverage. The only difference is when you call a customer service, which inevitably you have to do with a mobile plan, you actually get an English speaking American on the phone.\",\n",
       " \"So go to patriot mobile.com slash CR or call 972 Patriot. Use offer code CR to get free activation. If you're a veteran or first responder, please let them know because they actually support you rather than hate you. And we'll offer you a special discount. So again, join our movement today and make the switch away from the cartel. Join parallel economies with Patriot Mobile. It's patriot mobile.com slash CR or call 972 Patriot.\",\n",
       " \"So folks today everyone is yelping about inflation because the CPI came out today. And like, look at that Democrats, you said you promised to lower inflation so much for that so much for build back better. It's not any better. Prices are up so much for the Inflation Reduction Act. Like what you fools. They're debating the Democrats as if this were the 1980s or something. Like we have a intellectual debate over how to best deal with inflation. And you guys are wrong.\",\n",
       " \"We have a better plan. No, they believe in it. They want it. They arsoned it. That is the point. They don't want reduction in prices because they want you eating bugs and walking instead of driving and living in. I don't know if you've ever seen these simulations where they have these mock cities they want to build that are a couple hundred feet wide and long where everyone's living in some sort of transhuman utopia. That's what they want.\",\n",
       " \"And they're achieving it. And they're achieving it because the same Republicans that just use these feeble talking points a couple of weeks before an election to militate and they against some of the worst symptoms of what they helped cause. They fail to realize that they mean business and Republicans help them get to this point. It's pathetic. You know, it's interesting. Republicans will only fight.\",\n",
       " \"I noticed the only issue they seem to care about is the student loan thing of all things that have happened to us. They've killed millions with the lockdowns and the shots and the creation of virus and the more more stuff they plan on creating. You cannot even go anywhere to get normal treatment for anything. Health care is destroyed. Food they're in the process of destroying. Fuel everything. We need to interpose against the tyranny.\",\n",
       " \"You have the FBI now going after anyone who just espouses the political views of Trump and they're roping them in, subpoenaing them. And obviously of crime the border. They might indulge it as a talking point here and there. But the only thing they get all excited about. So one of the things I keep mentioning is that governors need to get together and form an alliance and say this and this doesn't happen in the state. FBI, IRS don't violate human rights.\",\n",
       " \"We're going to work together to build our parallel economies to secure food and fuel supply chains and infrastructure, medical freedom. It's going to be a constitutional sanctuary zone. No. The one thing I think pretty much every GOP governor signed this, they signed a letter complaining about the canceling of $10,000 worth of student loan. Again, I don't disagree with what they're saying, but it's just funny how that's the one thing they understand.\",\n",
       " \"But they don't really understand it because again, why are student loans out of control? Because tuition is out of control. Why is tuition out of control? Because Republicans joined the Democrats for several decades in funding the subsidizing the cartel. The same way they complain about inflation and they caused it. By the way, what I wanted to say for today is that even though gas prices are down a lot, inflation is worse than ever, particularly with food.\",\n",
       " \"I mentioned this throughout the last couple of months. Gas prices are a straw man. None of us like it when it's high, but the truth be told, you're paying a couple hundred dollars more if you travel a lot, maybe $1,000, $2,000 more. That hurts, but what's even more is everything else. What this demonstrates is it's not just because of the gas supply. There's inherent inflation across the board. Why is that?\",\n",
       " \"That is because of the trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary pumping that Republicans have supported for decades and culminating with the COVID craziness. They literally tried to call up Thomas Massey, even the conservative ones to convince him not to call for a recorded vote that day, March 27th, 2020. So almost everyone not named Thomas Massey is responsible for it. But it's funny how Republicans won't even realize the cause of the issue.\",\n",
       " \"They don't understand the magnitude of it, where it's coming from and where it's headed, frankly, because they're a part of it. And again, that is why the bad guys neither feel nor fear any deterrent, which is why they now openly call their shots. If you notice, they will openly admit, oh, I don't know why we're doing this, but shut up. We're doing it anyway.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, the shots don't work, but that's why you need a booster. We're going to do this anyway. They admit it. They admit that their policies serve no logical purpose other than the purpose we know it serves, which is control. But they know they don't need to even intellectually defend it because nobody's going to hold them accountable.\",\n",
       " \"You might have one or two people poke at them, an elected official, an outside commentator, but you don't have a critical mass movement that has power. And the reason you don't is because it was done that way by design to have this controlled opposition. And I want to show you a perfect example of this. But first, our final sponsor today, Policy Genius, it's not an insurance company, but they aggregate for you online.\",\n",
       " \"So in a couple minutes, you just put in your information and they will show apples to apples comparison of the best quotes for life insurance. Those of you who roll your eyes at life insurance just understand that most people do not get enough coverage through their job. You usually need about 10 times more, especially if you, you know, you're like me, you got a family of four kids.\",\n",
       " \"And I don't mean to be rude, but I mean, especially if you got the shots, you better be looking at this because with an 84% increase in life insurance claims for the middle age brackets because of sudden adult death syndrome, AKA mRNA genocide, those rates are going to be going up. So you should go to policygenius.com slash Daniel and do your shopping right now.\",\n",
       " \"You could save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius and more than just a website, they actually have a team of licensed experts. So you could call their hotline to better understand the options that are laid out for you and apply for a policy with them. And again, they're not a company that sells insurance. They work for you, not the insurance companies. And so you could trust their unbiased help and advocacy. They don't add extra fees.\",\n",
       " \"They don't sell your info to third parties. Since 2014, Policy Genius has helped over 30 million people shop for insurance. They placed 120 billion in coverage. So head over to policygenius.com slash Daniel to get your free life insurance quotes and see how much you could save before that window of opportunity closes.\",\n",
       " \"By the way, with that window of opportunity closing, I mentioned yesterday and I have a column out today, this New England Journal of Medicine study that shows that those who got the shots, even though they already had the virus, wound up having less protection than those who didn't get the shots and never had the virus. Because the shots not only make it more likely that you get the virus, but it erases your natural immunity. So I mentioned that yesterday.\",\n",
       " \"But amazingly, if you look at the conclusion of that study, they say, therefore you need boosters. See, this is what they do. They're like, yeah, this is going to kill you. You know, you've never heard these pharmaceutical ads. There's like 30 seconds worth of disclaimers. This might cause brain bleeds and heart attacks and strokes and diabetes. But make sure you pick up your pack at the pharmacy nearby. It's like, what? What did you just say?\",\n",
       " \"How does like one plus five equals 27? It's like, yeah, this thing erases your natural immunity. That's why you can't rely on it. And that's why you need to constantly get more of it. And they get away with it openly. So with that, I want to play here. An amazing clip, you might have heard it. It was going around the internet last week.\",\n",
       " \"There's this Australian senator, Senator Pauline Hanson, during a floor debate in their parliament, asked Penny Wong, who's the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on net zero, just to define for us what net zero is. And we all know what it is. It means that you choke off all so-called carbon, which basically means you have no food and fuel, which is exactly what they want.\",\n",
       " \"Hence, walking around naked like cavemen, eating bugs and sewage water and, you know, nothing that actually works to enhance your life. So she asked her what it is. Just define for us what it is. Take a listen to this unbelievable clip. Would the minister please explain to the Australian people and I what net zero emissions actually means in layman's terms? Thank you, Senator Hanson. Minister. I'm not sure how to explain it other than to say it means net zero.\",\n",
       " \"I mean, you know, and I understand that the senator, it's one of those situations I will think through if I can provide an explanation to make it clearer than that. But to me, the words net zero are quite clear. I think we all understand what net emissions means. I am reminded of a time when I was climate minister and I think Senator Fielding wanted an explanation and I got in the chief scientist to try and take him through it.\",\n",
       " \"And we did get to a point where I thought I don't actually know. And neither did she at that time. How how to break it down any further. But I will have to think about that. I think it's a commonly understood objective and it's an objective, as the senator knows, that is shared by those opposite. I thought maybe not. Well, obviously not Senator Canavan. I know that.\",\n",
       " \"But the coalition, I thought broadly, had had agreed to net zero emissions by 2050. And maybe Senator Canavan is indicating a change in policy under the coalition, under Mr. Dutton. And and obviously, I think it's 84 percent. I could be wrong. Australia's exporters have also export markets have already signed the same target was discussed at the G20. So there's broad global agreement about the need to. Minister, please resume your seat. Senator Canavan.\",\n",
       " \"So again, that was Penny Wong, the minister of foreign affairs. She's like, yeah, I don't know what it is. I'm not a scientist. I can't explain it, but everyone's doing it. So we're going to do it. It's like they will do life altering, civilization changing policies at the drop of a hat and openly admit that they can't answer basic questions about what it is.\",\n",
       " \"It's safety, it's efficacy, and it doesn't matter. They don't even fear it because, yeah, you'll have one person here or there, a Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massey, a Chip Roy and, you know, this senator, Pauline Hanson in Australia here or there. But they understand that the basic power structure controlling the more so-called conservative party in whatever country you're talking about, and it's really all of them, they're in on it.\",\n",
       " \"They are totally in on it. And the way in America, the Republican Party is in on it because the conservative movement is in on it. You see, conservatism in this day and age has no fixed views. OK, there's no fixed views.\",\n",
       " \"At any given moment, what conservatism is, is finding the most extreme thing that the left is saying or doing, complaining about it, and then excusing everything up until that line, thereby allowing the Overton window to shift inexorably to the left ever, you know, everlasting. You know, everlasting. It never ends. OK, there's always, in fact, the left is always moving over because the phony right allows them to move over. So we never reclaim territory.\",\n",
       " \"And they're always able to think of new things. And you see this perfectly with the Pennsylvania Senate race. Everyone, even Tucker had had Dr. Oz on. They're all excited about we got to defeat Fetterman, you know, because the left always provides you with fodder that they're crazy. I mean, you look at Fetterman, you're like, how could a guy that had a stroke? He literally sounds like a caveman, looks like a caveman. The guy's utterly retarded.\",\n",
       " \"How could a guy like that win? This is unjust. We have to defeat him. But defeat him with what? With a guy who's going to be subversive? He's not even promising to support our values. He actually tweeted out yesterday that he's supporting gay marriage. He's not even waiting till after the election. Again, these are things the left could never do alone. They need Republican buy-in. They need Republican buy-in. It's subtraction by addition.\",\n",
       " \"I was going to say addiction because the conservative movement is addicted to Republicans. So this is what it is. Fetterman is such a clown show. I almost fall into the trap. It makes me want to, all right, I'll just hold my nose and vote for Oz. But we've been doing that for 35 years. Okay, 33 years, whatever, since Reagan. When we're going to keep doing this? What is the plan to change this? To evacuate us from this morass?\",\n",
       " \"So anyway, Oz tweets out this article, this Washington Post article. Yeah, I'm a part of this. I'm happy. So what's this article? It's a Washington Post. Prominent Republicans push GOP senators to support same-sex marriage bill. This is a critical week for the same-sex marriage bill as Senators Collins and Tammy Baldwin continue to work to win enough GOP senators. They're getting help from some Republican prominent Republicans, including GOP Senate candidates.\",\n",
       " \"More than 400 former and current GOP officials have signed a letter that will be released today backing the bill as part of a campaign led by Ken Melman, who managed former President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. Among the signatories are Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Mehmet Oz, Joe Odeya, the Republican Senate nominee in Colorado. So you have two Senate candidates, National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons, George W. Bush's daughter Barbara Bush. I didn't think she gained any clout with that.\",\n",
       " 'You have Trump figures like David Urban, the pollster Tony Fabrizio. So a whole business there. Log Cabin Republicans are involved. So there you go. Think about that. I even said it in front of this microphone a couple months ago. For the first time in a generation, I felt we were actually pushing back that Overton window and reclaiming ground on culture, putting the other side on defense for the grooming, for the drag shows and all of that.',\n",
       " \"And we were actually starting to win on that issue where people for a while, they didn't understand, okay, what do I care about? Marry, gay marriage, give them the license. And we all warned like, well, that's the point. They're able to do what they want anyway. What do you mean let them do what they want? They were always able to do what they want. They could always live together and do it. No one stopped that.\",\n",
       " \"Why do you need to redefine an institution? Something that doesn't mean it must mean that you're trying to codify it as a right. And you're going to force that on other people, force it in culture, in society, even on religious institutions everywhere. And lo and behold, that's what's confronting us today. It's become a culture, a runaway culture. Every year, a new letter of the alphabet soup representing another licentious act codified as a human trait and a right.\",\n",
       " \"And yet Republicans take that and they're like, yes, exactly. We're going to help ban marriage in the states at a time when we need to evacuate the red states from the federal government. The federal Republicans, including the ones that are running for this great GOP controlled Senate, that here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it that states cannot define marriage as a marriage.\",\n",
       " \"And not just in terms of a marriage certificate, but because it will be codified as a right. It will force it in all sorts of scenarios upon private individuals and institutions, organizations, schools, churches, religious colleges. That's your Republican Party. So that's why they don't care. They don't care. Oh, yeah, Arsha, they could get up there and say our shots kill you and it won't stop. Because why would it? The Democrats could all announce tomorrow.\",\n",
       " \"The COVID shots will kill you, but we're mandating them anyway. And Republicans will not challenge that because you can't be anti-vax. You have to support either. You have to be a homo. Okay, it's the same thing they did on crime in the border. I can't look like I'm anti-immigrant. I can't look like I'm anti-black. Right? Because somehow if you're like for locking up violent criminals, that's anti-black.\",\n",
       " \"But that's that was the GOP mentality on every issue that matters. I promise you, they could say it openly. What's happening today? Again, it reminds me of that old news agency from like a generation ago. They were kind of making fun out of the news. And they would have these women get up and give the news, you know, they have an anchor and a reporter. And they would, you know, put on a serious face.\",\n",
       " \"And you know, if you would close your eyes, the news was very serious. But while they were doing it, they would blithely take off their clothes one by one. It was they were I don't know if they're making fun out of the whole news dynamic or whatever. But that's what it reminds me of. They're like, yeah, and this is gonna kill you. And I don't even know what net zero is, but we're doing it anyway.\",\n",
       " \"And like, what do you just say? Like what just happened there? But they don't care. They're never gonna be held accountable. So that's Oz and gay marriage and everything. The sick little irony is, I mean, I don't know how lucid Federman always was. But right now he had a stroke. And it's almost certainly because of the shots. The guy was a young guy. Dr. Oz supports those shots just as passionately as Federman.\",\n",
       " \"That's the sick irony. Oz has nothing to run on. So now his only campaign is that just Federman is not physically fit to be a senator. That's the only thing he can run on. And that's the only thing they disagree on. It's like, I'm a communist, but I'm a healthy communist. And you might not be able to properly, you know, fulfill your communist duties. And I will. That's basically the campaign.\",\n",
       " \"But ironically, that only that difference only exists because the shots that Mehmet Oz, the Grand Pasha of Turkey supports. And by the way, if we're gonna brag about having the first Muslim senator, like whatever happened to the Koran, at least let's get the benefits of Sharia. But no, we have to find the guy that promotes the homosexual agenda. It's unbelievable. So we were winning on that issue.\",\n",
       " \"What's another issue that I don't know if I'd say we're winning on because Republicans aren't doing anything about it. But rhetorically, you know, again, the whole climate change, global warming for many years, it pulled very well, because everyone wants to support science or whatever. But now people really are seeing the pain. You know, for too long, food and fuel wasn't a lot of money, people didn't care.\",\n",
       " \"And we were warning, look, dude, they're gonna destroy everything, food, fuel, you know, these products, yeah, every little product you have, you don't realize it, but it's garbage. You can't even get anything to work anymore. But it was too subtle. Now it's not subtle. People do get it. Like, you know, they might be willing to give into the small time environmental agendas.\",\n",
       " \"But if you're gonna tell me I can't have live my normal lifestyle, that's all people care about. And yet, the guy who's considered by some to be the second most conservative governor after DeSantis, Kevin Stitt, and I mean, not by me, but Kevin Stitt, the Oklahoma governor, this from Yahoo News, climate change is less a threat and more a business opportunity.\",\n",
       " \"Speaking to more than 100 state government officials from across the western United States, Governor Kevin Stitt listed off the ways Oklahoma had embraced renewable energies and a greener future. This is not just some, you know, speech from 10 years ago when, you know, all the Republicans got sucked into it. And then now at least they realize how stupid no, he's doing it right now. The state's electricity grid offers business, some form of carbon neutrality.\",\n",
       " \"The number of charging stations spread out along highways conserve thousands of electric vehicles, and a plan to create a new hydrogen energy hub will help the nation move away from fossil fuels, they said at the Western Governors Association May meeting in Oklahoma City. While Stitt peppered in talk about freedom and the state's conservative way of life, the parts of his speech on energy sounded more in line with coastal Democrat, not a Republican governor from an oil and gas rich state. This is Yahoo News.\",\n",

That is what even the better Republicans are about. They're like, we're not here as warriors for you. We're businessmen.

They'll never even get 60 Republicans, right? So they don't have enough votes to pass anything good.\",\n",

Like so that's all designed to distract us. You'll never be able to pass it.\",\n",

Oh, boy, abortion. See, this is being shoved on us.\",\n",

      "tonight on all in. >> they know it\\'s true, they know it\\'s there, they know who won the election, but they refused to say your right. >> donald trump himself was in on the scheme to seize voting machines. tonight the most incriminating evidence of the trump coup plot yet. the back man he used to help him do it and with the investigation is discovering from torn trump documents. then, the republicans suing to disqualify madison cawthorn from congress for engaging in\\n            \\n            insurrection joins me live. plus, jelani cobb on the right wing crackdown on teaching black history as black history month begins and one year after a certain senator\\'s great escape to cancun, or works says that texas has failed to prepare for another freeze. all in starts right now.good evening from new york, i\\'m chris hayes. we have new revelations tonight about the ex presidents coup plotting that contain some of the most incriminating evidence yet, i\\'ll explain. so in the weeks following the election with his defeat appearing one more certain trump\\'s scheme to sustain power, as we have chronicled on the show, became increasingly desperate. and his personal lawyer, rudy giuliani, had been spreading all sorts of conspiratorial nonsense about the voting machines\\n            \\n\\n            for weeks. falsely claiming that the voting machines rig the election for biden. >> it\\'s way beyond what people think. including a very very dangerous foreign company that says -- that\\'s not american, that\\'s far. a company that has close ties with venezuela and thereforechina. and they were using venezuelans company software that was used to steal elections and other countries. i don\\'t think people have an idea of the dimension of the national security problem this dominion creates -- this dominion company is a radical left company, one of the people there is a big supporter of antifa. >> just be clear, that\\'s orderly false. essentially invented. it\\'s so false that giuliani got sued by dominion for defamation. but the voting machines, the idea that inside the black box there was some magical for and subversion coach, if that was something that giuliani was going off,, we know this, because shortly after the election, the times reported that giuliani reached out to the acting deputy security about seizing the machines to overturn the results of the election. and mr. cuccinelli said that there is no authority that could assert control over the voting machines in the states. at the time, the new york timesreported since it was unclear whether mr. trump facilitated the phone call. well, a year later, we know the answer. as a new report in the new york times details, six weeks after election day, trump wanted the department of homeland security to seize the voting machines. according to the paper, quote, trump directed his lawyer, rudolph giuliani, to make a remarkable call. mr. trump wanted to ask the department of homeland security if it could legally take control of voting machines in key swing states. okay. just step back and think about this. because there\\'s something important in all of this. dumps president of the united states, he has a question about a matter of law. what he as the chief executiveof the country is in charge of. the department of homeland security reports to him, he\\'s the president. but he did want to make the call himself. how. his we are despite the sense about what could be in line with criminal liability appears to -- there is a concept called the errand boy. someone who runs the money. so the bus can keep his hands clean. and trump appears to have realized that he needed a fall guy to do his dirty work for him. so he turned to rudy giuliani, the same bag man he used in ukraine. the guy who got him impeached the first time while he was trying to dig up dirt on the bidens. this little detail to me is profoundly revealing. why doesn\\'t the president call the guy a dhs? why doesn\\'t he go through normal liaison\\'s at the white house? because he knows it\\'s wrong. he\\'s gotta get his dirty tricks to do it. because it\\'s evidence of guilty conscience and corrupt intent. if the president, ex president, thought when he was doing was legit, he could\\'ve called the dhs himself, he was the president, but he knew, he knew seizing the voting machines waslawless possibly criminal. something had no authority to, so he sent rudy. go safe he can take care of that? his personal lawyer to take care of the dirty work. and while giuliani made the call even giuliani had his limits short of what trump swear. quote, mr. giuliani was vehemently opposed to the idea of the military taking part in the seizing -- seizure of machines. yeah. i think that sounds like a bad idea to. you see some of the more conspiracy adult allies hatched a scheme by which the army would be the ones to, i don\\'t know, rolled up to voting centers and roll up the supposedly corrupt voting machines which, that would\\'ve been great. in other words, fullauthoritarian rule in which the military in camo and their weapons go and grab voting machines. and the last bulwark of democracy was apparently rudy giuliani, of all people? at least in this one tiny incense? the man who is not particularly known for his sound judgment these days. and that thought is i salute the terrifying. i should just tell you in the past hour, the new york times also reported that the committee investigating january six is looking into trump\\'s role into the proposal to seize those machines. we also got an interesting revelation from the washington post today. i think it\\'s also kind of evidence of corrupt intent, a guilty mindset. and it\\'s about a particular habit of donald trump we\\'ve known for years that trump had the practice of hand shredding his documents. in fact, the government had employees on payroll taping trump\\'s documents back together. you see, there is such a thing as the presidents records act. and it requires that all the men must be preserved. and i can tell you people take this very seriously. very seriously. and yet, apparently, in flagrant and in continuous violation of the law he wouldtear up the documents. the string evidence is second nature. well today we learned that some of trump\\'s documents to the coup, the documents that he wanted to block the committee from accessing, included papers that had been shredded and needed to be taped back together. we don\\'t know what specific documents were destroyed. that has not been made public, but as the washington post reports quote, legal records indicate that the documents over which trump sought to assert privilege included presidential diaries, appointments. handwritten notes concerning the events of january six from white house chief stuff mark meadows, speeches, and more. but the specifics are not quite as important i think as just the general practice. which speaks to the same thing that you can see in that instruction to -- dhs. the corrupt intent that is inherent in donald trump\\'s actions. he did not want to make thecall himself, he didn\\'t want to leave a paper trail. as one staff told political, quote, he would rip up anything that happen to be on his desk that he was done with. he was always told doing so was illegal and it\\'s worth keeping in mind when it comes to the attempted coup, there are almost no contested facts here, okay? think about this, we know all these things. a lot of it happened in the open. rudy giuliani went on tv to talk about the voting machines, as i just played you. there are multiple written memos from trump allies outlining the strategy. we conclude this way, we could coup that way. trump said that he wanted pence to do was overturn the election. that is trump\\'s own phrase. so at some level, we all agree on what happened but. trump\\'s only remaining defense for his actions to drive astake at the heart of but a mare can democracy, is that he was diluted, so fundamentally out of touch of reality that he sincerely believe the utterly ludicrous incoherent theory of injustice, that the election was somehow stolen from him from his byzantine, internally entered contradictory set of actions. so we acted out of good faith to rectify this injustice that he truly believed. but this evidence completely of this rates that notion, which of course was never that possible to begin with. if trump really believed he was not doing anything wrong, why did he not called the department of himself? but why is he ripping up pieces of paper to hide the trail? i think the answers pretty obvious. is because he knew he was doing something wrong. and he wanted to keep his hands clean. jacqueline alemany is thecongressional correspondent, one of the early authors of the tutu newspaper. it is part of the team that broke the story that the documents had been ripped and taped back together. she joins me now. would you like to tell me more about the state of these documents that were transmitted to the committee? >> yeah, chris, we\\'re still trying to figure out more about these documents exactly because as you noted, the committee has not officially detail what was in this trench of 700 pages worth of records that was transmitted from the national archives to the january six committee investigating the insurrection. so we\\'re not quite sure how valuable some of them had been shredded up and then taped back together might be, but we do have a number of clues including a review of court records which materials former president trump sought to assert privilege in his unsuccessful efforts to prevent the transmission of these documents. and these potentially included some of the presidential findings concerning the seizure and security of the 2020 election and these votingmachines. we\\'re not quite sure if that included the memos that you just showed that the new york times and politico has unearthed. and we don\\'t know if those were specifically turnip and pissed back together, but the national archives also told us that some of the documents today received from this past white house were shredded apart and not put back together. it\\'s also unclear whether or not it\\'s possible for those to be re-created and once again decipher-able. so there are still a number of unknown questions but i think this unusual -- became public in 2018, we\\'re now seeing the real world consequences why the presidential acts exist so that if there are serious investigations taking place, these interiors that really big long to the american public are easily available and ready. >> and we should know the committee has been moving on abunch of fronts and they\\'ve been getting a lot of cooperation. they won this court case that got these documents. they also have been talking to some expensive people and i want to get your sense of this from the reporting you\\'ve been doing. we have two key figures in pence world. marc short, last week spoke to the committee, of course he\\'s someone who is very prominent in mike pence\\'s world. he was also there with pence string everything in january six. and today greg jacob\\'s former chief counsel to for vice president mike pence, was spotted leaving the committee after many, many hours of testimony. i think that benny thompson called immigrate patriot. what\\'s the significance of the extensive cooperation of those two individuals intense world? >> these are highly significant interviews and depositions that these two players who were around the former vice president during the time when this pressure campaign to overturn these results of theelection was taking place. we reported a few months ago, i believe, and november, that greg jacobs, in particular, was having a number of exchanges with john eastman while they were even under siege in the capital in hiding as insurrectionists had breached the capitol security and were shouting and chanting, hang mike pence. that, mike pence had time and the chance to do the right thing. those emails extended even as late as 8 pm i believe, i might have to refresh our reporting, of john eastman emailing craig jacobs that mike pence could employ some constitutional loophole that pence\\'s legal team have already found pretty questionable in order to ultimately send the slate of electors back to the states. but mark short and greg jacobs were, again, key witnesses to all of these different playersand these outside legal teams that were trying to convince the former vice president to go along with president trump\\'s plan to overturn the election. >> all right jacqueline alemany, thank you very much, i appreciate it. senator sheldon whitehouse is a democrat from rhode island. he is a member of the judiciary committee and he joins me now. senator, i wanted to get your thoughts as someone who has been around the law, most of your adult life, and your former prosecutor. the significance of the revelation that you have rudy giuliani being asked by the president as a kind of cut out to call his own sub cabinet officials of the department of homeland security to investigate the seizure of machines. what that says to you deep down? >> i think it would certainly add color to any prosecution, the hand ripping of documents and the weird giuliani electionmachine errand. but i suspect that at the heart of any case will likely be down in georgia. where the effort by the fulton county grandeur really will be proceeded. and to which the jeffrey clark, the doj guy who wrote the letter to georgia, whatever is being looked at or suspected up -- points down to georgia. and you have these electors who fall -- filed false electoral ballots which is a pretty straightforward, i think, 18 usc false statement violation. so you have a lot of people who might quickly become cooperators once the presented with whether chances are in that criminal proceeding.and all of that adds together, i think, into a pretty rich mix of evidence and witnesses who are a lot more credible than rudy giuliani. >> i want to ask you about mitch mcconnell who is i think, attempting to sort of straddle the line between a forthright defense of american democratic institutions and a party that is controlled by donald trump. he was asked about trump floating the notion of pardons over the weekend for some of the folks that engaged in the insurrection. and this was his response. take a listen. >> well we saw here on january the 6th was an effort to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another. 165 have pleaded guilty to criminal behavior. my view is, i will not be in favor of shortening any of the sentences for any other peoplewho pleaded guilty to crimes >> when you think of that? >> i think he\\'s right. and i think he\\'s trying to create some distance between himself and trump. mitch tends to play the long game and i don\\'t think he wants to bind himself to trump. in such a way that when, as, and if trump collapses, mitch goes down with him. and it\\'s pretty clear from the film and from what we all experienced on that day that these lies and this behavior out of trump with pardons and all that is simply unacceptable. and you can be as partisan and cynical as mitch mcconnell and still feel that way. so that\\'s a pretty strong benchmark. >> we kind of are in a process of discovering where the lines are. i thought that giuliani saying you can\\'t send in the militarywhile trump sort of ided-ing on it is an interesting example of finding where peoples lines are. one of the channels through which they pursued this was in the courts where they had zero success. and i think that\\'s -- you know, that\\'s a point in favor -- >> not zero success. they had clyde burn laughed out of court and in some cases lost law license isn\\'t were sanctioned for their behavior. so it\\'s as bad as it gets. >> of course, there is a pending -- there will be a pending vacancy in the judiciary committee. the president is now considering of various nominees. what is your expectation about this process? >> it\\'s interesting, so far in all of the contested supreme court proceedings, mitch is going to the mattresses to make sure that the federalists i. d. s was able topick out the judges and they got through come hell or high water. the whole garland episode, all of that. it\\'s interesting though, now he\\'s packed a 6 to 3 court. and it\\'s not clear to me what mitch mcconnell wants is a lot of controversy and attention around the court. he\\'s got the court he wanted. it\\'s a 6 to 3 federalists society a majority. it\\'s already starting to just walk deliver for the donors. so creating a raucous around it is like drawing attention to the house in which you\\'ve got your burglars operating. it\\'s not clear -- >> [laughs] >> that might not be in your best interest. >> a court brought to you by the holy trinity of mitch mcconnell and leonard leo and donald trump together in wielding their power. senator sheldon whitehouse, thank you very much. >> thank you. >> ken members of congress be barred from running for office again if they had any part and what happened in january six?that\\'s the question at the heart of a legal fight unfolding around madison prefers -- unless cawthorn can prove that he had no part in the attempted insurrection, he must be taken off the ballot. so what will this mean for other january six republicans or even for donald trump? that\\'s next.it\\'s our ultimate sleep number event on the sleep number 360 smart bed. it senses your movements and automatically adjusts to relieve pressure points. and it\\'s temperature balancing so you both sleep just right. and now, save 50% on the sleep number 360 limited edition smart bed. the democrats, with all the plus, 0% interest for 24 months. only for a limited time.fraud they have done in this election, the republicans hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice!make no mistake about it, they do not want you to be heard! there is a significant portion of our party that says we should just sit idly by and sit on our hands. they have no backbone! >> that was 26-year-old north carolina republican congressman madison cawthorn, riling up the crowd, on the morning of january 6th, 2021. just three and a half hours after what you just heard, the first rioters, smashed a window at the capitol. hunter walker, who -- said cawthorn was one of the republicans in congress who participated in or had top staffers joining conversations about the event. now a group of north carolina voters have launched a suit with the state elections board alleging that congressman cawthorn, who is seeking a second term this fall, does not meet the constitutionalrequirements for a member of the house of representatives and is therefore ineligible to be a candidate. and it cites the 14th amendments disqualification clause, which reads, no person shall be a representative in congress who, having previously taken an oath as a member of congress to support the constitution of the united states, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.\" state law requires the board to hold a hearing on the challenge. that has clearly spooked cawthorn, who yesterday filed a federal suit against the north carolina election board to block the hearing, saying that running for office is a quintessential first amendment activity and afforded great protection. robert orr is a former associate justice on the north carolina supreme court and a lawyer for the voters challenging congressman cawthorn\\'s eligibility and he joins me now. mr. orr, i follow this case because it is fascinating and somewhat legally novel, i think at least in the modern era. sketch out the legal theory behind the claims in your suit.>> well, under the 14th amendment, section three, which was put into our constitution shortly after the civil war, there is a disqualifier for anyone who does three things. one, to have taken an oath to support the constitution of the united states. secondly, there is an insurrection or rebellion against the constitutional authorities of the country. and three, engage in or aid and support insurrection and rebellion. and that is a disqualifier from holding public office in this country. and in north carolina, we have a candidate challenge statute and a group of voters utilizing that statute that filed a challenge, alleging that madison cawthorn, who has filed for reelection in a different congressional district, is disqualified under the 14th amendment, section three. >> so you have a state law that provides the sort of means of redress here,which is that you can use that state law to challenge candidates for a variety of reasons. is that right? >> yes, that\\'s correct. there are any number of disqualifiers, qualifications in the u.s. constitution and also in the north carolina constitution. and this is a statute that has been used on a number of occasions to address those kinds of challenges. >> yes, it\\'s an interesting case. because on some level, the first amendment equities on the other side loom large. you don\\'t necessarily want some board saying who can and who cannot run for office, willy-nilly. that\\'s a profound power to wield. at the same time, if someone said, i am 14 years old and i\\'m running for congress, you would need someone to say, well, you cannot do that. [laughs]you are not qualified. >> that is exactly right. there has to be a winnowing of anybody and everybody that may want to file for office. but i think the important thing to emphasize here is that this is a disqualification set forth specifically in the united states constitution. >> yep. >> a disqualification to address the kind of situation that we saw on january 6th. and granted, it was enacted originally after the civil war. but what we saw on january 6th and surrounding it, including the activities of mr. cawthorn, they clearly fall within the purview of this amendment. >> that is the question, right? you would have to establish that what his activities were constituted engaging in that insurrection and that those activities themselves, speaking on the ellipse, were not protected first amendment political activity. and the argument that people make about the ellipse rally is that it is is distinguishable from the criminal assault onthe capitol, from people just expressing their protected views. >> well, what we are finding out -- and your prior segment certainly addressed a good portion of it -- is that it is more than just a physical assault on the capitol. it was, as mitch mcconnell just said, an effort to undermine the constitutional, peaceful transfer of power to the newly elected president. and so the insurrection just isn\\'t the violent assault on the capitol but it is this broader activity in which the constitutional principles that our democracy relies on were subverted by a wide range of people, including, as we allege in this challenge, congressman madison cawthorn. and his lawyers have filed suit in federal court, raising a number of issues, trying to block this challenge. but we are prepared, on behalf of voters and our entire legal team, to go into federal court, asked to intervene and participate and intervene withthe attorney generals from the attorney\\'s office, representing the state board of election, and get that thrown out in federal court and perceive as quickly as possible, improving our case before the panel appointed by the state board of elections, which can be reviewed by the state board and ultimately

from harvard and devoted his career to the study of african american history. all the way back in february, 1926, he launched negro history week as an initiative to encourage the teaching of black history in public schools. over the following decades, the idea gained popularity, students at kent state thought of expanding it to a full month in 1970. and president gerald ford officially recognized black history month six years later urging americans, to, quote sees the opportunity to honor the two often neglected accomplishments of black americans in every area and govern history. today, since the first negro history week, we mark the first day of black history month.and it\\'s feels like we are moving backwards. confronting things that we felt we left in the rearview mirror. of course, over the years, we have seen a new push to tell the full bloody unvarnished truth about race in american history. racial hierarchy, racial pressure. that endeavor is under assault. it\\'s led to a backlash equally as forceful with more and more efforts to stop the truth about black history from being taught in american schools. a third of american kids are not being affected by new laws and policies that impose restrictions on teaching, so-called, critical race theory that imposes restrictions on how teachers can discuss things like racism and systemic inequality. in montana, a legally binding -- prevent schools from asking students to reflect onprivilege. a texas law ban schools from requiring teachers to discuss controversial issues. and idaho law 0. 2 point $5 million to remove support from social justice program. new hampshire has a new law that ben divisive concepts which is enforced by citizens who can report teachers and sued the school district. they are using that same concept in virginia where newly elected governor, youngkin has a tip line for in quote, was -- there\\'s a recent -- removing the classic the bluest eye, and a north carolina high school just pulled dear martin about a black high school writing letters to dr. martin luther king junior. the way that is society teaches and learns history is always going to be in his capably political because it is bound up in the conflicts and power relations of the president. what we are seeing across thecountry when it comes to teaching black history is no different. i will ask jelani cobb what that tells us about where we are as a nation, next. n, next. \\xe2\\x99\\xaa\\xe2\\x99\\xaa hey, do you know if i work sunday? sure do! clover does that. who are you? he\\'s from clover. clover does that so i can do this. i like that green. chef, can we hire another hostess? umm... psst. yeah. i was gonna add an exclamation point. and one chicken salad. anything else?yeah, do you also take orders online? yeah, we do that. yeah, we do. thank you. clover does that. this is really good. secure payments, the tools you need, people who can help, we do that. talk to a clover business consultant today >> on this first day of blackhistory month, a time and for celebrating black stories and reflecting on past injustices, we saw an awful situation in historically black colleges and universities. at least ten schools received bomb threats which prompted lockdowns. that followed seven threats yet from yesterday. no explosions occurred and no bombs were found. if -- they are like working with law enforcement to see the region of this. a stark reminder of this first day of black history month. jelani cobb at the new yorker and he is on staff at columbia university. and he joins me now. jelani, i cannot remember a time in my life really where i felt like the true radical vision of what black history month was conceived as has felt more important and more under assault than this one this year. >> no, and to the point that you made about doctor blitz in and, i\\'m probably a member, a life member of the organization he founded, the association of the study of african americanlife in history. but to the point that you made about it, he was deeply involved, throughout the course of his lifetime, in the work of making the knowledge of black history ask accessible to teachers. that was one of his motivations and creating negro history week, as you pointed out. he had an going dialogue, he created a negro history bulletin. he was trying to translate academic work into lesson plans that could be used by teachers. so a very explicit and specific purpose which was this was meant to be a brief for negro citizenship. in full quality. and to see the heartbreaking element of this is -- i mean the inspirational part of it is called visionary. doctor woodson was. but the heartbreaking part of it was we are 96 past year the initial effort and we still have the necessity to do exactly what he did. >> and the thing i keep returning to amidst all of this fighting, and i want to getinto some of these laws is that you know, i had an incredible history education. in the -- very lucky. in the top, top percentile. i had incredible history teachers. and there was so much i didn\\'t know. there\\'s so much i didn\\'t know about the nature of reconstruction particularly, and the re-\\'s assertion of jim crow. there are huge swaths of americans history of racial hierarchy and racialized violence that even people with very good educations just don\\'t know. it\\'s a factual matter of things that happened in this world and the winnowing of what you do and don\\'t learn is inherently going to be guided by some social and ideological consensus. >> sure, it also has a diagnostic purpose. if you examine these histories to better understand the context in which these catastrophes arose, you could hopefully navigate around those things in the present and in the future. and with these obstructions that are being thrown in the paths of teachers, bear in mind as a sidebar, i thought thatthe conservative right was very much interested in local control. and all we keep saying\\'s statewide intervention into what people can teach in the local and county level. but when you look at what cannot be taught now, you can\\'t talk to students about why we ultimately had the biggest war in american history. what led to it, why we have a 13th, 14th, and 15th amendment. one reconstruction was. how texas left mexico and the fact that racism, white supremacy, and slavery were at the corner store enough that. how florida came into the union and andrew can jackson\\'s concerns about black slaves escaping into what was then spanish territory in the 18 teens. how missouri came into the union. we\\'re not talking about the history of california in thecompromise that created a federal bureaucracy to track down fugitive slaves in order to allow california to come in as a free state. the fundamental history of the country\\'s illegible if we exceed to the ridiculous demands that are imposed upon schools and teachers by republican legislatures. >> all of that is so, so well said and so important. and what i\\'m also struck by and this -- you touch a little bit on this in your piece in the new yorker, the sort of narrowing that happens. it\\'s so well to find ourselves 180 degrees where the notion of comfort or divisiveness are the operating principle, this is all cloaked in and not make people feel --not making kits feel uncomfortable. and obviously, you have a third grader, you\\'re gonna talk to them in certain ways. you know. you do want to stress him out too much, you know, about the horrors of slavery. but the idea that comfort is this sort of operating pedagogical principle now imposed by the right to courted off what can and cannot be no is a remarkable irony given the space of the snowflake stuff we were subjected to over the decade. >> short, and i think the ideas that we want to terrorize children, of course, we believe in teaching things that are age-appropriate. you scale according to the complexity the children can grasp in at any point in time.but it\\'s very dangerous to impose the standard of comfort because you cannot really teach anything that the history of this country to the extent that we can say that there\\'s greatness in this country is about people overcoming circumstances that we decidedly uncomfortable. so that\\'s the actual tradition that we should be keeping up. instead, we needed history in order to serve outside of a lesson. it can\\'t even serve as an inspiration, in this context. >> yeah, we jelani cobb, who carries on proudly the tradition of dr. woodson. who i had never heard of before, incredible man. thank you jelani. >> thank. you >> next, nearly one year after winter storm path toppled the power grid in texas. the grid is still not fixed. o\\'rourke joins me, next.it\\'s time for the ultimate sleep number event on the sleep number 360 smart bed. what if i sleep hot? ...or cold? no problem, the sleep number 360 smart bed is temperature balancing so you both sleep just right. and it senses your movements and automatically adjusts to keep you both effortlessly comfortable. so, you can really promise better sleep?yes! you\\'ll know exactly how well you slept, night after night. we take care of the science. all you have to do is sleep. and now, during the ultimate sleep number event, save 50% on the sleep number 360 limited edition smart bed. >> there is another big winter plus, 0% interest for 24 months on all smart beds. only for a limited time storm heading towards texas tomorrow nearly one year after a brutal winter storm and cold wave left texans desperate for health. remember, 11 million peoplerisks left. texas says the 246 people died in the storm but a buzzfeed news analysis estimated more than 750 people were killed. and while texans were freezing without heat or running water, ted cruz flew to cancun before he was shamed and defamed until he returned the next day. it was very clear at the time that greg abbott said that it was the power grids entire infrastructure especially the fossil fuel infrastructure that failed. advocating for -- miss challenges for the governorship on both the left and the right. so as temperatures started to dip, once again across texas, he promised the power grid wasn\\'t better ship this time. >> i\\'m very confident about the great and i can tell you why, and that\\'s for one, i signed almost a dozen laws that make the power grid more effective. i can guarantee the lights will stay on.>> you heard that last line, i can guarantee the lights will stay on. that\\'s a pretty unhinge statement. i can guarantee that the lights will stay on. that\\'s what he promised months ago. the texans will not lose power this winter. but now, with another serious storm done in texas, greg abbott is locking back his guarantee. >> we have a very substantial winter storm coming in the next few days, it will be in the state of texas for the remainder of the week. no one can guarantee that there will be a quote, load should event. >> amazing wording there. to translate there, a quote load shed event, is a planned blackout which would mean texans losing power, just like they did last year. o\\'rourke has been campaigning as governor. he just drove across -- he joins me now. it\\'s good to have you. let me sort of offer a defense to begin with and get your response to it which is thatthe texas grid is its own grid, it\\'s one of three grids in the entire country. texas has its own, it\\'s called ercot. it\\'s complicated, it\\'s different cold, you can\\'t fix it in a year, and this is a very bad storm. you can\\'t really blame the governor if things go sideways. >> chris, this is the energy capital of the world. and you have far worse weather in other parts of america. you don\\'t see these kinds of outages, you don\\'t see this many millions who\\'s in power, and you certainly don\\'t see americans freezing to death in their own homes or dying of carbon monoxide poisoning, or starting fires in their apartment to keep warm and then burning to death as a result. the fact is, the governor was warned for years before 2021 when the storm happened that we had vulnerabilities in the grid, and did nothing. and add insult to injury after this great failure, as you pointed out, he has done nothing to fix the major culprit in the power outage last year, which was the lack of winterization of a gassupply. that might have something to do with the fact that those in that industry have given him millions of dollars since the february freeze including kelsey warren whose company made 2. 4 billion dollars in february off the suffering of our fellow texans, and road greg abbott of 1 million dollar campaign contribution check. that would explain the other wise inexplicably as to why we haven\\'t fixed the grid as we head into another winter. >> this is slightly we\\'d see, but bear with me here. my understanding is that some of the recommendations around winterization for texas would be one of the sort of costly insurance. you have to winterize at a certain amount of capital cause so that your insulated ensured out into the worst kind of events. and generally, the industry doesn\\'t want to do that because we make them spend a lot of money to upgrade the grid. >> whatever they spend, and i\\'ve seen estimates that it\\'s one to 3% of their operatingcosts for these gas supply companies, it\\'s a hell of a lot less expensive than losing a life or more than 700 lives. or the more than 100 billion dollars it has cost the state of texas so far, or the tens of billions of dollars in insurance claims because, as you mentioned earlier, when it froze, the pipes froze as well, and then the leader burst, and it created damage all across the state in texas. and, if it can\\'t go worse, it has and that\\'s because our utility beer bills have also gone up. it\\'s the abbott tax in texas 20 to $50 a month per utility pair, whether they live in an apartment, a home across the state of texas. and not just this month, and not just for this year, before the next 20 years to pay back the mess that abbott and those in the gas apply industry made in texas in the first place. so we\\'ve got to make sure that we have regulation andoversight and protect the people of the state. we literally cannot survive in other extreme or severe weather event like we saw last february. >> quickly, the governor has been at the forefront of some of the legislation executive actions to restrict education and curriculum in texas schools. do you think that the laws are the palace -- are justified? do you think that they should be left in place? >> what i love everything that jelani cobb just said in your interview. we have an extraordinarily rich history here in texas. in el paso, the first person to start the chapter of the naacp also fought -- ending in the 1944 smith versus all right decision. you have thelma white who integrated higher education here in 1954, right here in el paso, texas. if she has a 18 year old woman could face an all-white education system and defeated, then the young people of texasare strong enough to learn a story today. so when make sure that we learn and understand the full rich history of texas. as a governor, i\\'ll make it a priority. >> all right, beto we\\'re o\\'rourke running for governor in el paso, texas. >> thanks chris. >> that is all in on this tuesday night. with the rachel maddow show starts now, good evening rachel. thanks to a home for joining us this hour. as you can see i\\'m still here and my home studio, that is because i was exposed to somebody with covid. i\\'m still testing negative. i am fine. i am vaccinated and boosted, but i was definitely exposed. because i cannot wear a mask while i\\'m doing the show in the studio, i have to broadcast from home so i don\\'t risk exposing any of my coworkers bygoing into the studio. so that is the only reason i am home. other than me trying to do this myself while having absolutely no skills as an audio engineer, a lighting engineer, and makeup artist, or camera operator, other than that, everything art operator, other than that, everything should be fine. ahem. forgive me for everything that may go wrong. i\\'m happy to be here. thank you for being here. we\\'ve got a lot to get to tonight. so, he was a late hire in the trump administration. they didn\\'t hire him until year four in the trump administration. he hired him in march 20. the administration hired a new lawyer to work in vice president pence\\'s office. en a man

      "\"ah ah whoa, happy new year special kaiser report with the one and only gerald salenti, originator of the trend forecast man, no stuff. we spend every new years eve with joe select the if he will have us even if he won't have us. we just like hang outside his house and say, hey tara, let us, let us in gerald, welcome to kaiser report. thank you so much for having me. i admire both of you so much for all that you do. and the information that you give the people around the world. thank you so much for having. but we've lived through another year 2021 and we're heading into 2022. i suppose. we'll kind of look back on 2021. as we head into 2020 stay with you. the biggest trend that you report on in the trends journalright now is of course, the c word which, you know, alternative media such as ourselves, are not allowed to mention anywhere on social media including you to where this is also broadcast or twitter. we kept mentioned the c word and even, you know, the fact that that total economy, that the financial system, the monetary system have been totally reengineer. and we've been flooded with trillions upon trillions and trillions of dollars of new money to fix this c word situation where and the fact that we can't really talk about it here. let's talk about that trends and don't mention the c word you can say, pandemic. i guess, but the fact that we have this weird situation of a sort of orwellian moment. like what does this tell you? 0, one of things or look what is going to happen with the global economy as they're forcing people to do it, they don't want to do and they're excluded from going out and traveling. take a look at the data. and this is from the wall street journal,back in the beginning of this month and happy new year. everyone and see you in maxed the bookings between the united states and europe for the week starting november 29th. and this is going to mid december. we're down 77 percent from the 2019 levels down 77 percent j. p. morgan and now sta, we're not going to have our big health conference in san francisco. we're going to do it by zoom or a oh, don't worry about all the restaurants. solo tells all the businesses, the taxes that come in with conventions and trade shows. they're gone. you're looking at office occupancy rate in america at 4.he percent. that means 60 percent aren't coming in. what happens to all those businesses? and now, with the fear that spread with the new, i see were heard that came out of a moronic via part. the look what they did during christmas holidays, all over the won't buy all of the western world. oh and china, a chinese doing great. did you see their numbers coming it? oh yeah, consumer spending is down that you're a housing is down. numbers are going down to all locked up, no travel. so this is very serious. we think one of the big trends that we're looking at in 2022, they're saying stagflation. we call it drags lation. economy is going to drag down, and inflation is going to keep going up. and when you're looking at,you're looking, by the way, john williams shadow stats. you, i admire his work, you know, because they, rigs the, the inflation of his housing is included. oh, you're not eating steak any more of all you, but you're eating ground beef. it didn't go up the, the prices didn't go up, so they rigged the prices for 2 reasons. so they could keep interest rates low, and the gamblers could keep gambling. and so they don't have to pay more people social security because it's, it's geared towards inflation rates, the real inflation rates, about 15 percent. so when you're looking at interest rates, you have negative interest rates. so now they're going to raise interest rates are gonna raise a, made me to raise them, you know, to 3 quarters of a fed rate, about 3 quarters of percent. either even afraid to do that because they can't stop the slow at cheap money. so we see this thing going down and inflation going up, drag lation, not stagflation. and just quickly look how they lied to us,or it needed a light, or they got to be the dumbest people on earth. let's go back a year ago, december. this isn't your own power the fed head. oh, this inflation is nothing. oh, it's only temporary. oh no, no, no, from temporary went to transitory. and now they're shay, well, you know, because of the, the supply chain disruptions and other things. it's not supply chain disruptions as that much of it. it's all this cheat money had dumping into the system that saw it officially propped it up. he said something interesting there about the resa interest rates are low as to keep the speculator speculating enough to point people over luck. they are told that the re, the reason interest rates are low is to stimulate the economy to stimulate job growth and to stimulate the ged pain. while we know actually the reverse is true that by keeping rates artificially low, they are sti, meaning a job growth. they are killing the economy and as you point out,it's purely for the benefit of those who borrow at those low low rates. and they speculate in the financial markets which are now magnitudes bigger than the rail economy. and when they make a bad bet, they get bailed out when they make a good bet, the keep the proceeds. what's interesting, gerald, is that they were able to hide the inflation for a long time as you point out by using had donek adjustments and substituting hamburger for stake or bugs for stake now. but now we've got a situation where it's obvious that prices are running away as people notice it for groceries and for energy. so j powell, when he's testifying before congress and saying that they're thinking about maybe raising rates at some point if they see some inflation, it's clear now to the population that this man is. and it is a tyrant, essentially it's not aimed at to put it into historical terms. so you'd have to go back to benedict arnold to find somebody in american life who was so obviously,and patently, undermining the integrity of our government in our way of life. gerald, you said most people know that people that listen to you and, and stay see. yeah, the people that you know that the mark morse's in ear, george gammons myself, you know, we're, we're a minority. most people believes a b s. and that is, and of course the mainstream media keeps repeating it. this is the worst that the fed gang has done since they were invented by another murderous clown that a woodrow wilson in a 100 a years. they've been lying to us and say, oh, when inflation rate goes over 2 percent, a number, they made up back around what, $2102012.00 we made, we made the number up to percent. and now it's way over 2 percent. and we're thinking about it, we're not too sure, but we'll let you know. you mentioned j. p. morgan had cancelled their bigconvention the conference they were going to hold in san francisco. and actually, not only was it, some of the see were in a restrictions, but most people were afraid to actually go that by attendees were afraid to go to san francisco. maximize, don't we, we refuse to go to san francisco. and so let's talk about that because we've used the quote from basta all the time, paraphrasing prep, frederick boss, yet saying that when plunder becomes a way of life for men at the top, you know, they cree of more legal system and a moral system to justify it, and it seems like san francisco is the epitome of that. not only do you have nancy pelosi, representing the region and the congress. and she's like, arguing for insider trading by congress, members of congress. but you have the, the state of california has said like, we won't prosecute anybody who steals under a $1000.00. so it we, you've seen just get won't go broke for real happening ina wild way in california. and we have refugees fleeing that's heading to texas, heading to florida, heading in or out of those sort of states. what do you think? what's the trend with that you, you, you talked about california, the exodus rate is it's, it's, it's, it's off the charts. when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose. and they're losing it and they're losing it all around, all, all across the country and around the world. again, the rich got richer as max was saying, you know, they used to cheap money to buy is an artificial merger acquisition activities and all time high. why don't people want to go back to work? where do i want to go to work? i want to work with home g po. no, i think amazon, my, you know, i like dial a general. where are you going to here to job starbucks? you know, you got to job in starbucks, you could be the, if he is the new person coming and makes almost as much as you do, which equals next to nothing. how could you live on $1215.00 an hour?look what's going on in the housing market. oh, housing markets going up, but people can't afford to buy them. so the apartment rentals are going way up because they can't afford to buy. so the people that have when this, when they lock down, things people say themselves, i don't want to go back to work. i don't want to do that anymore. i think i'll go stealing rob, who's even stealing a robbing from me? why should i steal and rob from them? yeah, good point. and that's become plunder away of life warned about by frederick boss yet. oh, back in the 19th century. you know, so something interesting is happening in the trend. watch area sick, a secular move. you'd have to go back to the 1970s to find something similar. and that is the return of labor organized labor in a push back by labor against the financial world. typically, historically, economically, there's always been a pendulum swinging back between and over law financial ice world like we saw, the 1920s,led to the 1900 thirties and come back of labor. you could call it. now we've got the from the reagan ism up until present day, the total financials ational the economy collapsing in 2008 and continuing to collapse today. for now, there seems to be a movement towards labor. is that a secular move? is it going to be with us for a while and where does it go? it's one of our top trends to 2022, actually unionization, and i mentioned stop upstair, the one that's leading to charge you got caught kellogg, deer, and a number of companies to people. it's, it's supply and demand issue. so now they can that now they could now they go on strike. now they can demand not to work and demand more money because people can't find employees. so this is going to be with us a while and, and at now all. so i'm not saying the right or wrong, the good of the bed. i'm putting the fact out even a demand more money, right? inflation keeps going up. right? again, even though they demanding more money with inflation. as i said, the real, if he used the fake inflation number at 6.8 percent,wages only went up 4.8 percent. so it is still down to percent. so they gotta keep fighting fits right, because i have no food at the new york times describe that loss of wages as an improvement in wages. so here's a nobel winning economist. you can add or subtract apparently. but i want to ask you about the this labor organized labor, because i've often said this is, i think, a position i've never heard by anyone but myself make this position that the minimum wage laws are the poor man's central bank. in other words, if you're on wall street and you get to borrow money at 0 and make 15 to 20 percent a year without any risk there, there is a counterbalance of that in terms of the people who are out of wall street called minimal wage. i'm all for getting rid of the minimum wage and let the free market determine wages. if we can currently get rid of the central bank. gerald,i want to say we're going to come back in the 2nd half after this break. we're going to top up or champagne glasses for this new year's eve special. we're going to come back with an answer. this is a cliffhanger. first ever on kaiser report. ah, i was diagnosed with cancer in 2005. when the doctors told me the cancer was incurable, i knew i had to make a change. so i decided to travel one of the most toxic places in america. florida went to florida is biggest industries, and best kept secrets is frustrating and the biggest player is $85000000000.00 industry is mosaic. i. there are reports of millions of gallons of contaminated water now flowing into the florida aqua for a chronic. oh, well, you know, i don't want to hear that word poets, but that's what it is. in 2013 my, all our family dog, my brother, who was 21 years old,myself and my father were all guy with rob problem did. they brought a whole wrong and the good play. right? yeah, yeah. maybe they'll actually learn that more help is more important in aah welcome back to the kaiser report. i'm next time we're going to continue with our conversation with the one and only gerald salenti the way we left before the break. i asked the question, i said i'm the only one that has this particular position that i know of, and that minimum wage is the poor man, central bank. in other words, i'm against minimum wage and a free market economy. i think free markets to determine prices, but an economy that's governed by the central bank, which is a polar bureau, that sets the price of money. it's a centrally american communism. you need to have a counterbalance called the, the minimum wage or otherwise you're going to have slave slave lambda as you call it. what, what do you think, gerald, what's the minimum wage? it's, it's nothing it's, it's just a phony phony number, the throwing out there. right? well, just trying to clear that he's doing something to adjust for the real inflation that you mentioned. the minimum wage in america would be now $60.00 an hour, which is a living wage. and that's the way would be if there was a frame,if there was any adherence to any economic principles outside of the delusional coffee. coming out of pol crossman. that makes no sense. right? gerald, i'm totally against the government putting any kind of mandate on what the wage should be and who would they to decide anything? because tell me anything that they've done where you could show me a success rate. i know the africa had what they did. great on that one. no. why are you talking about the nobel peace prize? how about the nobel peace prize? you? oh, that was that guy, obama that got it. yeah, i want that. i couldn't see at, at it. we're going to destroy would be the richest country in africa with people had more rights in and benefits. and then a lot of your peers, i want that guy is sought out at arid syria. how about that guy over there in ethiopia that they just gave the nobel peace of christ when a gift to oh yeah, the one that started the war against achieve christ. and now you have the 2nd mostpopulated nation in africa at war. so going back to the nobel prizes, they have no bell pieces of and the people that get them fit into that category, obviously. so again, in a free market economy, the government should be telling us nothing to do other than i believe i liked it, sherman anti chustek, the clayton anti chustek, the glass steegal act, the robinson patman at dad presented the bigs from monopolizing the country. and now the world, let's follow on the 2 themes here. so 1st of all, you mentioned that the return of labor is it's going to be a good thing. is it a bad thing? and of course the, the story of labor in america and capital versus labor is intricately tied to the situation with china. china took all our jobs because the capital sent all our jobs to china. so we see that they said it is trap happening is um,is there going to be a war which i know it looks like in that the last weeks of this year of 2021. we saw a lot of like multi front conflict starting to emerge between that declining empire and the rest of the world. now we don't sue or which shine as a city united states could. what could be a bill is $680000.00 taliban. it couldn't win, couldn't win in, in, in iraq. now, erica touched shine. and shine is going to do what they want. one of our top trends to 2021 was china, 202120th century was the american century. and the 21st century is going to be the chinese because the businesses america's been walk in the business of shyness business, they're going to do what they want. and, and not, of course, i'm not for it. i'm saying, what is it, who's going to stop the me going to take over, which i want to going to do what they want. and now they're making you deal with russia. so it china and russia needing was america go to unite with who's going tofight them and they get no, i don't see it happening at all. and if they do go to war, it will be that was where they asked einstein, what kind of weapons will be used to fight to 3rd world war. he said, i don't know, but they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the 4th. yeah, you mentioned russia and china now coming together, and that's been in the works for quite some time. they have of course, one road, $11.00 felt beltran initiative, which is tying that whole region together. and it's part of that enormous economic zone that is going to be dominating for quite some time. the one wild part of the in the geopolitical arena. and this is pure speculation. but if you put russia and china together, how, how tough is it going to be to put germinated with those to the charities that you know, they're interested in money? and i don't think that if they go for the united states attacking russia, getting involved in it,i think the cherry what we should be looking at all. so what's going on in the middle east, particularly with turkey, with their, their leader has dropped 45 percent just this year alone against a dollar their real inflation rate as well over 40 percent. and again, one of the things i always say when all else fails, they take you to war in order to win, as i have a very good track record of doing at the, the, the president, particularly with his popularity slumping. and so i'm concerned that we're going to start seeing more action breaking out with turkey against other countries, particularly syria, the kurds, and the other one to look at to is what's going on with israel and iran with the nuclear deal. so to me, the concerns are with the war front bar, the middle east, and again, what's going on in africa. they don't make it in the news, hardly at all. what going on in,in ethiopia is very important to look at the whole horn of africa, which sudan, this, this is bedlam up there. and by the way, you want to see a migrant crisis happen. you haven't seen anything yet. you mentioned that if we have a war with china, the next war will be with fought with sticks and stones. but one of your trends for 2022 is you know, citizens, especially of the west of a high surveillance state, high tech world. seeking low tech alternatives and you can you explore that trend further about a low tech future is simplicity is they do they've, they've gone to check in to anyway, we're talking about a supply chain disruption. look what's happened with the automobiles. you know, once upon a time, it was very, very simple. and now something breaks down on your screen and it's like a $68000.00 problem. the same thing with equipment. so now you're going to startseeing a lot of companies going back into simplicity. now we don't have to make it that complicated. so you're going to start seeing that and it would be a great entrepreneur. opportunities. do you know what the product, the average price is? automobile now in america. 40363 dollars, 40000 dollars. well you making $15.00 an hour. maybe. how are you going to afford that? no, there would be smart to becoming back with was simplistic automobiles and more simplistic equipment because they've gone way too high tech. they used car market is trading at a premium to the new car market. and so that's very unusual in it. it shows a market failure, right? because there's no good price signals and the, the answer gets back to money printing. so even if there was a return to a more simplistic automobile manufacture, you know, you still have the problem that the economy is a wash in all this fi out money. and there's no way to pull it out. they know theycan't raise rates because of what we discussed earlier. structurally, the bond market won't tolerate it, so they can only go to the question. is gerald, are we having into a hyper inflationary? why mar republic collapse, or will it be a deflationary 19 thirties, depression type collapse? i think it will be a combination in the sense that there will be, as i said, a dread flacier. you're going to see the economy go down and inflation keep going up. and it's, it's not going to go away and it will d a y more republic. i think more of more of that in the sense that the, the standard of living is going to continues to decline dramatically. and then again, you're going to start seeing a lot of a lot of conflict going on, new political parties being formed against the establishment. the, there are, there are a lot of people are totally disgusted what's going on. and so i believe there's going to be, as i said, drag flayson rising inflation, declining the economy,declining living standards, and going back to an occupy wall street mentality. one thing that came out occupy wall street was the one percent. no one ever talked about that before. and now the one percent are in total control. and you going to start seeing rebellions going on, and again, goes back to the unionization, all 3 of us live through the stagflation of the seventy's. what advice do you have for the zoom or is in the millennials? of course, back then we didn't have a surveillance state, we didn't have social media, we didn't have a med averse to escape and to we didn't have fentanyl and all these sort of narcotics and high overdose test. so it's kind of a different scene and structure in the u. s. economy at the moment. but what, what sort of advice is mr. begin for them. on this new year's eve speaking only for myself, gsp, gold, silver bitcoin. and you, so it happened in the middle of december when the set even came out in the citywere going to raise rates. all of a sudden, boom. gold jumped back up again. silver started gaining more strength and bullish on silver. by the way, not so much is say david, but them using it more and more in industry, particularly solar, paddling and other things when you throw silver. so good in all the computers and everything else. so that's why i say, and of course is no body that knows bitcoin him, he's got, that's guy. who's the number one can i feel he was the 1st to call it out? and so i'm, i'm totally on board with would max has been saying on it. and i'm, and i invested, i read recently that during the pandemic and people were locked up at home. a lot of people took up new hobbies and one of those hobbies a lot of became very popular. people started to cultivate plants at home. and this story was about people have become addicted to their plants and they're going broke, taking care of their plants. and i noticed you're sitting on a set right now and you're surrounded by plants. have you develop the plant thatdixon gerald? now i have over 20300 plants in my office and thats norma. and the reason i do is i, i try to surround myself with beauty and get my mind to a, for the ugly going on. so i take care of the plugins and stuff that's why i took it . and i quickly on that thing you were just talking about because joe biden, this year, his administration did mention that sanctions against countries like around was more difficult because of big coin. and i think that was a profound statement and kind of ties to your theme of a possible war. and whether or not that might happen is if, if, if, because makes it impossible to have these sort of wars is it can bring some sort of piece. what do you think of that? now many actual do anything. they don't care about facts. and again, to me it's, this is the safe haven as said. so what i'm looking at and looking, and i mentioned to you about 40 percent occupancy rate in office occupancy. right?what is going to happen? a commercial real estate sector. oh and when interest rates go up, what's the debt level in the united states only was 30 trillion and they just stopped it again. you got to pay more money now when interest rates go up, was gonna happen all the junk bonds. so you're looking at, you know, did when interest rates go up, well this debt levels going to explore well, an explosion is a good way to pop the bubble. into their 2022 year, we all look forward to speaking to you again and happy new year, mr. buggy himself. thanks for watching kaiser port. new year's eve specials show at gerald. the last day. bad guys are stacy harbor until next year, buffy all, ah, withoh, you can have a test bed for medical and then later recreational marijuana and it started with something. so in a saying, i was wanting to socialize, everybody does it for why can't i. and then it just keeps going and going and going, i'm just going to do it was yeah. and then it's, i'm just going to try this was never do it again because they want my phone was on and i have you right on inside. ok. and you surround yourself with people who are encouraging you to do it not to stop or it felt like my life was over, jump off the balcony and died. mm. use the justus things that have happened in the world would be done by people who had a great vision of how society could be better. but that great vision is typically the last time this year representation is not real. it doesn't take into account any of the complexity of reality, the subtlety of how various and complex people i put them into categories is this lot is bad. we'll get rid of them. you know, and change is an organic process. changes on evolution and the opposition is not between the status and everything must stay the same and everything must be radically changed. a radical change is not the way that that kills aa, as the world celebrates the new year, are t looks at some of the positive predictions for 2022 with financial experts forecasting the global economy is set to grow, while inflation will start to fall and of course we review the year that has just gone as well with a look at some of the big political spats that unfolded, including a controversial defense deal. it's all france at loggerheads with its allies in 2021 was many things, but it also gave the online world plenty of ammunition to have fun making means from pretty sanders and his mittens to a boat stuck in the show. as now we look at the top events of last year deemed worthy of digital mockery with.\"\n",

      "\"ah, for june . welcome to the alexander. so i'm a very happy new year to you. oh yes, happy new year, but before we bid a final form for well to 2021, we thought we'd take a look at some of the show highlights from a turbulent year. corbett still dominated in 2021, and they still feel that the leading international expertise help understand. and we'll see this pandemic for 100. you're protecting young people from something with a risk profile, the sorts of the same frequency as the side effects of the vaccine,but the wider protection isn't being taken into account. so i think it's a difficult decision. i can see why they've made it, but i would personally have supported encouraging. anyone is talking about getting a job because i think it will contribute to our ability long term to control the virus. if she were a score and has been very, very powerful over the past years, it's important that we continue that kind of a chest we as we do. ready actually and a lot of, i mean i'm hearing stories of people being told to solely i'm used. ready by seen robin for somebody to give it to you, you're not allowed to give it to someone who's not here or whatever. that's just nuts we need. we need to trust program staff to to do the right thing with it. and full set, real state for health and social kind of study johnny to lay a lot of singular singular emphasis on boosters. boost is boost, as isa smoke screen. the important way of my in case numbers will be as follows. it is multi layer. it has to be multi layered, so you have to immunize people who have not yet been immunized. you have to give the boosters to the wonderful people. and furthermore, you have to also address issues. the other issues are equally important. the other issues being where you mock very properly where you can kind of places where you don't buses, tubes trains, and kind of supermarket for them all the big elephant in the room that we're not addressing. and this is extremely serious, is the seasonal influenza vaccines. we need to suppress influenza very much so this year. so it's a multi pronged approach multiple layers, as well as please attend to seasonal influenza immunization urgently. so what the, our score our score card is. we've been able to prove that 10 are actually now 13vaccines are safe in that case just by different regulatory standards. but by and large, that's the answer. so that was relatively simple. we did it in record time starting from scratch. it in january 2020, getting to vaccines, approved by november of 2020. great. the bigger questions though aren't around vaccine research and development. but really around can we make enough of this vaccine in order to vaccinate 8000000000 people around the world? and then can we distribute that actually do we have a logistical system in place that will be able to put jobs into the arms of those a 3 people and those are going to be far more pressing questions this year. and next we know what struck me about at least scientist doctors that we had on what excellent communicators the become limited really explain things that were the ones we had on explain things very well. and at the end of the day, the public are always after much detailed information as it can get to help themoversee the crisis that the all of us have seen and lifetime. so i think there's a general position of having people on for a period of time to explain the situation. but colon dominated the headlines. international power of politics was also back with a vengeance in 2021. a new president was faced in game and the afghan stuff, the most inglorious ignominious american foreign policy, the treat since vietnam come along. wilkinson was the late general colon paolo's, chief of staff. he described for us how america entered the 20 year long war and tara while i'm for follow just professor wade davis and professor as well. um and explained what the flight from can bill tells us about the future. the moment we selected the war instrument, we elevated al qaeda and it's like 2 warrior status. we even had extraordinary difficulty coming up with a term to describe them. so the geneva conventions and other things wouldn't applyto them. we lost and we understandably last. i think because president bush himself told a group of, of angelica was visiting the white house. my rage is up. please help me, help me restraining my rage. i think that was the most telling comment. the then young neophyte, inexperienced president made it was all about revenge and secondarily about preventing a 2nd attack. we thought if we went after the head of the snake, we would prevent a 2nd attack better. but it was an informed decision to decide to use military power. we now are bade in the mad assoni an morning of when you give the executive unlimited more powers, you are on a dangerous track, a very dangerous track, and we're paying for it. and i've kind of sounded just one of the debts we owe. obviously somebody had to pull the plug on that on that the, that,that war couldn't go on forever. bud sake. on the other hand, you know, the famous, sane by harry truman. the buck stops here and whether he likes it or not. those images from come to. ready light, the image is in 1975 in saigon, which, incidentally, it was interesting how the administration immediately went to those images with this incredible. and you know me think some and protest is too much refusal to draw any kind of parallels to what happened in saigon in 1975. but any one of the eyes to see could see on the video cameras. and i mean on the, on the television monitor that it was exactly like saigon in 1975. i mean, it was utterly parallel. you know, we, we left in 1975 nixon having spent billions of dollars to arm the south vietnamese . army was called the via the victimization of the american vietnam war. whole idea that nixon's can, you know, strategy was to get the american boys out of the coffins and back home. and,and we could, we could just use money and power and arms to equip an army that in the end had no will whatsoever to fight. and had just rampant corruption from the level of the field up into the presidential palace will surely that's exactly what we saw in afghanistan. but i also pointed out that when you urinate on dead bodies in a fun to sun, off, lushly put on down the toilet, that is going to upset. not only that i did, but almost since, and then to create problems. people didn't pick that up. and recently professor noam chomsky was considered now one of the leading of as the leading american public intellectual. again talk about this and then the end of june and said that this is the book that should be read. now after the fall of college, because me make the same mistakes again and again. but all conflicts. how the human side, and i just found it better. we can save on. wrigley,i wouldn't. once held captive by the taliban, i am icicle. his donnie ask, i mean, he has gone to great success in the king. don't look away the last time you walked away, you isolated the time on the international stage and understand became a play around for as we want to beach hockey. so don't walk away. it won't work, however, if you going to come back on me all of this time with a, with practical help with socialist motivation. i'm not sure the west can do that. but you know, that country needs to know me. if teachers, they have just kind of brain drain, they, they need doctors, professionals who can help rebuild the country on the west. this time can try nation building without weapons. because i feel like i've gotten womena so oppressed and they're painted as these. i mean, they're not, they're just the human eyes, you know, lives the getting lost left right, and center children and women and girls with what's happening right now. they're just in the, in the scene as numbers as these blue goes with the brokers. that's all i've got. women are known as a in the world, so i just wanted to show the world that know we're, we're also capable over just as good as anyone else. it was so lovely to see how my so wonderful success story, a for the crunchy, a young women of color who stands to well after coming over from from such difficult tendons. those interested in the other 2 women. quite different, but whose lives were touched by mascot est with both compelling stores. absolutely . in 2021, the political conference season was back. who better to survey the political landscape than the dwyer in the political commentary. professors of john curtis and 2 experienced political hands who disagree just about everything. former label m b,chris williamson and former tory minister, adrena cunning, the father braxton still structures. how people are going to vote. so much to the concern is a very considerable advantage. in contrast, remain, vote is still divided between labor to some degree than it would have a cross and north of the border. the ascent piece of our legacy of breck street bridge will be it is not in the headlines. you still very have a restructuring party choice. i'm because on the remain, so i devoted smart men to leave, so i, it's relatively concentrated, thus giving the conservatives and ballast. that means it's proven very, very difficult for labor to get the conservative blow 40 percent of what the lot of people are right now. it seems to me to speak their mind a sickness, thomas labor party. and, you know, we seeing the, you know,the propaganda building on the on t, china propaganda building up and we should be seeing the opposition speaking out about and, and opposing. and what we should be ongoing for is a huge investment in our public services. we have our own sovereign currency, money is no object in this country with loss of spare capacity. the only kind of inflationary pressures that are generated is when use when the government spends beyond or any entity in the economy for that much beyond the capacity to absorb it . and to see this latest don't say soccer, so called this deal between australia, u. k. and the u. s. is so just another example, it seems to me of how acts of touch are political leaders all but not dealing with the real issues. the real problems that are confronting every day people just only 5 years. so this is david, the cabin was falling over themselves, the cuddle up to the, the chinese and the course hensley point, a massive investment and chinese nuclear technology fora civil taylor lea exporting nuclear technology to, to a strayer, of china as the, as the target. what was going on, and when i cut it, oh, french were very, very upset about it, not these because they had the kids, they really didn't let me think about it. unless you know a bit sorry for them because they've lost this huge project, this enormous order for many billions of years worth of diesel powered engines are the french, the traditional enemy and we're orcus is going to do is enable them to have what lots of other countries including prompts have, which is nuclear power submarines. latasha would have been fantastic if we would be able to have up here at the school to get there. we could have a place that i proceed. oh, seen right here for everybody city. i was interested in the, one of the female voices in the house of lords,barren as clear fox. if anyone can upset musty convention, they clear fox is certainly can. will the irony is i think that corben is hm. did have a base. i might not have agreed with it. i might have thought it space was limited, but it gave a certain enthusiasm to a particular group of people around you know, what passes for life when politics. i mean, i'd be very critical of it. i think a lot, it was an, a dining superficial, but i understood it in food. people, you know, we did have big rallies. that's true. care star met. what does he offer? you know, he supported the corbin project, but was a bit lackluster. he was very much associated with the remain camp, which as i say is not going to play well. and then he comes in and is not clay. what he stands for, rather than not being corbett. they could have found a way of being a different party, but they didn't. and i, i think it's gone that. so the main thing i'm saying is if labor is finished in scotland, and i think that the lesson is the labor when i used to have mason,scotland spend every summer there, the labor party were the dominant party. i could never imagine in those days that the would anything other than labor domination and now look at them. and i think that the lesson is, is that once that slippery slope starts in quite as dramatic away, then i can't see how they can recover. it was interesting about clear false, often and untrue she comes across is quite competitive for it, but not $1.00 to $1.00 and to view a warm personality, a mass. and of course, great deep political think i have been the battle of ideas. festival has been partly her idea i say to soften were discussing before the hit that you know, when you just given that to say, consider a minute for a sign, but it's quite difficult to get your personality across at the end of the day. people do want to understand what politicians are all about, but join us after the break when we look at some of the show business highlights. so my 2021 shows you seating goodto what we've got to do is identify the threats that we have. it's crazy confrontation, let it be an arms race is on, often very dramatic. that development only really i'm going to resist. i don't see how that strategy will be successfully, very difficult time. time to sit down and talk with well, come back. the economics of the pandemic will occupy tech specs for many years to come. but all of us are living through the experience. we look for explanation from one end of the world to the other, from professor daniel by slow and dr. bit kidneys. i think there isa genuine issue to the countries that allow the virus to become more endemic, that even us the mortality, right? as for him, because the vaccination, right. so taking off, we should be very mindful of the fact that some is more than one way to create an economic costs from the pandemic and chronic illness, especially billets icing, and it's talking people living the normal lives working the normal jobs, etc. that's actually a very costly thing. and so if we think about the overall economic cost of the pandemic, we can think about the human cost of life and the g. p impacts of whatever measure we put in place to try and stop the forest from spreading. but we do need to be very mindful, sorry, of these other enduring possible health consequences. i think the only implications other people are worried. especially be young. i mean, the united states in the southern states, this is a, b, y, a we, we see a tory, the labels,and they didn't the own back. and we've never seen so that we have it from the united states all the way down to new zealand. of course, alex here and economist, you must have a view on the, on the long term impact of course it globally. well, with douglas for good friend, a very, very prominent economist. but daughter, it should be the i've never met before, but really interesting work on the long term impact, as you say, of long covert men. kim's john miller kanes, when served in the long run, but old dead famously. well, hopefully, long term we're going to be dead from cobra. but nonetheless, the long term economic effects are going to be with us for many years ago. it wasn't just economics and business, but sure. business which came back into life in 2021. what else did you online shows which prosper during lock bone was a wonder bugs on a warm summer day and these were the types we tooka trip to their chronic pinewood studios to find out why courtesy women are still good. that recognizing each other as a perfect example in front of us and appreciating each other, what you have to offer. do you get the same from remaining? sure business day. i mean your, your mom and dad. of course, the creases of lucky right on the things who got the fee amount to the old. oh, my dad. definitely. my mother was actually the creative entity. she was the one who came up with all the story lines that she built, the characters, she created all the characters. and she wrote most of the scripts. and yet my father, i got all the credit which isn't fair, is it? so it's so now, you know, people do say to me about, oh, it's great, you know, that to meet your dads into, to know your dad. but actually it was my mom who did everything. and in those days it was always the guy got his name above the title and it still, it hasn't changed that much really. and it said, people like yourself, alex, who,you know, you really support women of course tiles and goes without saying, but you know, it has been difficult for us and i think we should do more to get, you know, women's census data in the industry. it was so lovely to see debbie d and linda in person because obviously it is done online entities. it was certainly 2 of them before. and when does this finish that gate pantomime run, i think case enjoyed being awake a bit to not and of course d as you know, as, as busy trying to get justice for a mom. so yeah. who requires recognition as women, and she'll business should get, follow it. she did on thunder by fitness, wonderful to have such great women and went home fun to, to meet them at pinewood. sure. user colleague pain with the phone, all the, the bon forbes. you want us sean connery? yes. ed in sped it. no, thank god playful. so. no wonder both is a new online. sure. but the biggest blockbuster on tv now is succession startingdensity born. brian cooks as a profane taciturn pitt jack dungy, born look enjoy. he spoke to alex about acting life and politics. you know, i'm a socialist, i believe in gala trainer. so i believe that we're all, as i said, scott, we're all jock thompson's been and we only got equal opportunity. unfortunately some people are more equal than others and that's what happened. edge happened in the theater and i think it's really sad. i didnt, alex, i love success and being still enjoying watching it rises and really important here like job thompson's bearing for me as a, as a next phase presence of women of color. i know how much it means to people who need scott in the home. whatever it is comfortable to have that face activities, it's at my old job thompson's fantasy. it's a lovely face that the bride's a deep political thinker, but that i thought that the funniest story he told us was because look at roy's famously ix with the little for to everybody that people come up to brighten mathbecause it is such a super super asking for sophie's and wanting brine to swing them. asked look, and roy, i'm as good as image of of mind of people rushing up the right course and asking to be sworn. i've been going, brian of a probably does it goes, hadn't. are there any way that i was a good heart? i'm sure. absolutely. the future of scotland is on the bathing interest of the show . and 2021. we come to history and historical fiction for insight into whether scotland stands with it. well, the enlightenment in edinburgh is a fascinating chapter in history and it's not taught in schools enough. i don't think when i went to school, we did the industrial revolution to me. that was a bit, you know, was kind of boring to me. all the farming implements and innovations in agriculture should be learned about the scottish enlightenment. what a fascinating chapter in history that was eisley alex, you to main me one of these characters and mean that an a, an, an aisd way because the tame of love, visionaries, progressive thinkers,attainment, even the judges and the lawyers were philosophers and personally concerned with justice i think as you yourself said, when you were 1st minister, that would be fantastic to have thomas from europe and the other radicals, which would mean the radicals of 18 twenty's as well. written them to the curriculum of the press time, the peaceful time, largely the very fact that northern ireland itself is being used as a political football means that with them as well as the scottish fashion must, the proof of english incompetence that is actually much more valuable than shall we say a nationalist strain which kept on talking about grievances and how badly people are treated. the simple statement that the union is no longer fit for purpose. that seems to be the case as far as britain is concerned. all fascinating stuff and ihave to take this opportunity to thank and in the close life i'm representing a beautiful necklace, which i've worn on issue. and i will definitely wait again. so thanks famous and right, well that's going to contrast with it with these guys. we did a historical fiction historian also that the eating 20 rises of what we can say is a history in one way or another. and scotland is alive well and that me and i, scotland was in use in november as cop 25th decided the feature of the planet. and indeed whether there will be one we want to top scientists, the fantasy. alex sharma, a chair, is the color you take care of the carpet, laid out for things before people assembled in pasco. one was to come with better pledges to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from different countries that was not a success. and so that is a problem, a major problem for the world in that before the cops,the world was heading for about 3 and a half degrees of global warming by the end of the century. and we're still now heading for $2.00 degrees of global warming. so some progress, but nothing like enough. so that's got to improve in the next caught in the cop after that. well, let's just say you are the glass good. next we live. would you rather be would you want to be outside the conference hall giving these well leaders a pc of my door or tampa? would you like to be inside? go about a few solutions. well, i'm going to be there and i'm going to be outside because that i think is where things are going to happen inside. it's very important that we have this political process, this, this legislative process getting things right. but then what follows on from that is we've got to act on the commitments or we forecast for the new year . let this issue of carbon capture, the ability to pick carbon don't sit back and stood in the ceiling aquifers of the nor c o. it was, that was going to be a big issue in this coming. you know,that sometimes going to have to feature again on the shoe as well. there will be plenty location for me this year as well. my favorite, i just hate broadcast was from wembley. we previously the huge i put in england and scotland and the euro champion, who knows, with 14, is going well and qualification perhaps. so be a replay at this year's katara. well cup behind the tournament. the issue of racism and support was never far from this year's headlines. for an important reflection on the subject, alex turned to england. legend joined vines. very easy to point to thing rest. find the toes of an on, on the feel or who abuses you on twitter. however, real is that real racism, as i like to call it, is of the majority of you can't see it. it's obvious the overt racism the bananas under, under twitter. but of course, when you look at the fact that there are 30 percent blackfoot bowlers and they are probably less than 2 percent black managers,as much as black managers aren't being racially abused. the fact is that they're not being given opportunities. so why don't we speak about that? and that's, that for me is a big problem. it is very disappointing to think that there is of a still a lot of problems with that you guys, you said overt racism. don't get me wrong. i do believe denise come, that would become slightly symbolic. it's fantastic that not only your teammates, but your opponents, are being empathetic with your situation. and so i think now it's time to maybe do a bit more action if you like, can do things as a, make sure it doesn't keep happening as i've done for many years and was really good to hear from both john, i might with some real life stories of what face is supposed to print, and it's at many in society that the sharp hint of, of racism. and i, i hope that their knowledge, wisdom at nest dancing will allow them to, to demonstrate why things must get better though enormous dos of the 1980s. andthat's what remembering that both these place in scotland and england faced bananas being thrown at them regularly on the patch is extraordinary when you think about it and that they can talk about and such an intelligently as remarkable. incidentally, john bombs, i should say, was mileage and celtic for the police beat it, but he was keen to point out to me, statistically, at least a very successful what of course you find interest and felt it being high supported into tabby. no, it's alex. so that was a year that was a now is 10 state data. our christmas g to what's coming up next year. alex i spoke call. it will be over with us across atlantic, where the question is, can bible hollis escape the political was or are really vulnerable to accompany a comeback? and a home will a challenge from scott on. finally, a match to cause ballast johnson some sleepless afternoon. i suspect so well what every 2020 offers from all of us here issue our crew whole team would like to wishyou all a happy and prosperous new year. as, as we say in scotland, have a good new year. and we hope to see all again, next week until then. bye bye for now. ah ah oh oh yeah, it has to be rash. can be able to afford any time and find the luxury that for sure. despite having the most expensive health care system in the world,we have poor life expectancy. we have higher infant mortality. we have more deaths from treatable causes. so americans are suffering every day from it. it's as if these people don't count. i saw how you can choose your customers and dump a sick tone also a to satisfy their wall street investors. no parents should have to see what i saw. if you're denying payment for someone's care, your make life and death decisions and determine to get to live and who dies to me, that's best getting away with murder.the it is breaking news with our here and see international as protesters regroup and context on the largest city of nazi report . lee blocking access to local hospital the country. it's been a rough by days of deadly unrest ultimately, and originally triggered by a fuel price. well, in the meantime, and tara operation is underway, and therefore it's on the shootout. authorities say thousands of writers and offices have died with 3 of them report really bareheaded. we did have a chance to speak to one local john. now everything is broken. the money was taken, the windows smashed military helmets are lying on the grout. there's lots of rubbish and contact forces retake the country's biggest. that board officer it was over run by rioted, but flights are still grounded. leave.\"\n",

      "\"ah ah, his royal highness, no more. queen elizabeth, 2nd son, prince. andrew is stripped of his military title and world charities amid a high profile sexual abuse case. the u. s. supreme court votes to block jo biden's cobit vaccine mandate, large businesses saying that it exceeds his powers, though that hasn't stopped him from urging enterprises to implement the policy anyway. so american shops are struggling to fill the show. so the u. s. president insist supply chain issues have long been solved. we did it some grocery store to try to look for ourselves from in downtown washington area. they were finding the hardest, here all the pros. and this is where you witha lot of your charts and they watching our t great. happy company. very good morning to prince andrew. the 2nd son of queen elizabeth, the 2nd has been stripped of his military title. that is a mid day high profile sexual abuse case. he will no longer be known as his will, highness in any official capacity comes after us, judge refused to dismiss the civil lawsuit from a woman accusing the duke of york of sexually assaulting her when she was just a teenager. report him from london is shandey. i just dashti. well, it's a huge move from buckingham palace as prince, and you will no longer use his royal highness in any official capacity. as the queen has now stripped him of all of his appointments. so asa member of the royal family, he had many of these sort of duties. they will now be handed to other members of the royal family and that's been made official. and this statement with the queen's approval agreement, the duke of york's military, phil ations on royal patronage is up in return to the queen. the chief vehicle continued not to undertake any public duties on defending this case. as a private citizen. it's interesting to look at the statement in a bit more detail because it read that the duties have now been returned. of course, if we read between the lines, the queen may have applied a bit more for on to prince andrew to then give back all of those duties. but the 2nd part defending this case, as a private citizen. of course that's referring to the civil case that a u. s. judge gave the go ahead to just yesterday, the queen, 2nd son to face a sexual assault civil law. in fact, the duke of york is facing the most serious now of allegations of sexual assault against the minor, but junior to fray alleges that she was traffic by jeffrey epps,the when she was just 17 years old. and forced to have sex with andrew. now, since these allegations suffered some 2 years ago as military appointments were in abeyance off the he's step down somewhat, but he's still very much linked to around 8 british regiments, including the granted the gall to stream the angry consent. and they've been quite vocal about that because at many events, they will also even toast to prince andrew. so over the last 24 hours more than a $150.00 veterans wrote directly to the queen, off to strip andrew of all of his honorary military rolls. now that cause of course happened, we don't know whether that's because andrew will try and fight this case or try and reach some sort of settlement. prince andrew has always denied these obligations concerning his relationship with virginia to fray. even say he doesn't recall, even meeting her now for the queen herself is very much thomas. the reputation of the royal family has given them sucha dog reputation as ordered them entirely into disrepute this year. for the queen is incredibly significant. it marks the jubilee celebrations and so all of this is put a very dark cloud onto what was supposed to be a time to bring the country together. but for the queen herself. a an incredibly difficult position to be and not just as a monarch, but of course a mother as well as her 2nd son, now faces the most severe sexual assault allegation. to reiterate, former home office minister norman baker says that removing prince unders titles was the correct move. by the queen, i think we're going to have a summer, or a year old in pharmacy revelations, it under require to provide evidence to the american coach wants to put the distance between him and themselves as possible. so that's that, of course required, right? to say the legally people are jo proven guilty in this country. i didn't even america. and therefore,you could argue that you should operate until the cold case is you also in your rooms and let myself get him proper, really unjustly, distasteful, to carry on with that, he started what you need on the remote and they are within to get to the queen and was not as though he's being fined or anything like that to him. simply having what was given to him by the quitting taken away. the u. s. supreme court has blocks jo, biden's, coven vaccine mandates for large businesses. it would have required staff and companies with more than $100.00 employees to get vaccinated or undergo regular testing. although congress has indisputably given oh, should the power to regulate occupational dangers? it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly requiring the vaccination of 84000000 americans selected simply because they workfor employers with more than 100 employees certainly falls in the latter category. it is instead of significant encroachment into the lives and health of a vast number of employees. furthermore, we have a situation where the health care mandate for health care workers has been upheld. now this was brought to the supreme court by a coalition of republicans and business owners and others who felt this was government overreach, that this was the biden administration in the white house kind of stepping out of downs. now we have a statement from the white house at this point, joe biden says he's disappointed and as result of his ruling, it is now up to individual employers as well as state and local governments to make these kinds of decisions. but then we heard from white house spokesperson gen saki, and she said that despite this ruling, the biden administration is still going to put pressure on businesses in order to make sure their employees are vaccinated. a supreme court's decision on the osha mandate essentially means that in the pan this pandemic is up to individualemployers to determine whether their workplaces will be safe for employees, and whether their businesses will be safe for consumers as the president biden. i will be calling on and will continue to call and as and says to immediately join is those who have already stepped up. now at this point, despite the fact that this ruling has been overturned, we do have the white house and many of its allies adamant said that there should be a mandate that they may have lost at the supreme court. but that hasn't changed their desire to push a mandate throughout us society, but yet, this is another blow for, for the biden administration, at this point they are coded response has been unpopular. these mandates have been very unpopular. ah, this is a victory for the opponents of the white house or who have opposed his mandate and now have a supreme court ruling that is in their favor. we discussed, i rolling with peter, a research fellow at the american institute for economic research. he says,the course decision is a blow for mine. polls are showing very clearly the by demonstration is failing in virtually every category which has been out a week for about. his policies aren't having any effect on the spread of the con variance, which no policies could result. but with this on top of the december c, p i number yesterday, and it's difficult to see ratings, you know, left. on the other hand, the lower the ratings go, the lower they can go. but i expect that the, like we spin by demonstration on this, is that, you know, we tried to save you the supreme court stop, which is absurd, but then again, this is the realm of politics. as americans supermarket struggle to fill the shelves. president joe biden insist that progress is being made in raining in the countries 40 year, high inflation rates blaming lashes, 7 percent surgeon food and gas prices on global factors. but his rival point, the thing is squarely that his administration's policies under joe biden.everything costs more, store shelves are empty, and small businesses are struggling to hire workers and stay open. this trend is in transitory and it's all happening under democrats. one party control. disgruntled shop is also blame the president using go and posting images of empty supermarket isles under the hashtag bed shelves. biden, with ogden recently claiming supply chain problems have been solved. monte america decided to take a look from intrusion downtown washington. the area that we're finding the hardest here all the pros and this is where we find a lot of urine shops, vintage broccoli, red green vegetables at a mommy soybeans. things like this. they are out. here's where you would find, cut white corn, roasted corn asparagus. here. taking over to here is where you would finda lot of your was on yours, your pasta. is it pretty hard here as well? also, i did notice a lot of their routing chicken is gone. areas where you with fine chicken breast tenderloin, chicken breast need a shelves are empty of beef, chicken, eggs, fruit and vegetables. even non perishable items, difficult to find and some grocery stores. now in a normal year, 5 to 10 percent of food items may be unavailable today and nearly 15 percent are out of stock. that according to jeff freeman, president and ceo of the consumer brands association and officials say things may not get better for the next 12 to 18 months. now there are many reasons for this, including an increased demand for groceries with families choosing to eat at home during the omicron serge. as we saw here in dc metro area last week, winter storms have effected major interstate. and a shortage of as many as 80000 truck drivers are out nationwide say historic highaccording to the american trucking association. and because of this export say to expect price hikes and food shortage is similar to what we saw in 2020. now here's what you're seeing. as a result on tuesday, walmart, kroger, and albert's in stocks did albert's in thinking the biggest, indicating a trend among major grocers being affected by those supply chain issues. also, these trips to the grocery store are costing shoppers even more with inflation rates soaring to 7 percent for the 1st time and for decades now, with the united states seeing more than 700000 cases of coven 19 per day on average during this omen, crohn serge, it's slowing down food manufacturers and causing grocery store workers to call out sick. and we heard reports from companies talking about it had more positive tests in the past 2 weeks when they had in all of 2020. those positive text tests are taking people off the front lines. it's forcing companies to shut down manufacturing lines preemptively. and it's leading to just simply not enough supply. experts say that things may not return to normal until staffing levels are restored. this pandemic let's up in the global food distribution network is restored. the american red cross has declared its 1st at the blood crisis and does now less the wong day supply of critical blood products that comes as the only constraint sweeps, the nation, which is led to decline in the number of people donating blood. auntie spoke to the washington red crosses, communication specialist who told us that doctors are having to choose which patients get transfusions and which don't. red cross supplies, 40 percent of the nation's blood. and we typically strive to keep a 5 day blood supply on hand at all times what we've been experiencing as it relates to this current blood crisis, is that we've had less than a one day supply of critical blood products in recent weeks. so that's whatdistinguishes this particular blood shortage in terms of a capacity. blood cannot be, may factored or stuck out every 2 seconds. some wine in the us needs blurred. m, as doctors are being forced to make difficult decisions about who receives transfusions and who will need to wait until more products become available. so covered is definitely a factor in terms of the blood supply. as we're seeing a 3rd in cobit 19 variants that impacts the ability for donors to be able to give, as you have to be feeling well and, and of course not symptomatic. this situation will continue to become more dire and ongoing, and it will impact patient care tremendously. well, the 600000 people have reported left california and new york, apparently due to coven restrictions and high taxes, texas, florida,tennessee. they are the top 3 spots for relocation over 2000000 people from across the entire us of move to texas. california remains or top out going migration to discuss the reasons behind all this relocation with realty. julia clark, who herself moved from california to texas and kind of made the people have, you know, to pull the trigger. they're coming basically in texas. people feel like you can do what you want to protect yourself, but don't tell me what to do. a lot of them have jobs still in california that they can work remotely. why pay so high prices for real estate when they can live the dream in taxes? and far better neighborhood that is more family friendly. they see the kids out playing, they see the kids in school. whereas in california everybody's been in lockdown thewhole time. b as a taxpayer i was being taxed and tax and tax so hard that i, i just wanted to go somewhere that didn't have so many entitlement is that every single person that i talk to, that's what they say is that i didn't leave california in california left me now with americans trusting the mass media less every day scandal hit cnn has lost the lion's share of its fuels. is rating stop by 90 percent compared with last year on. these nicky aaron explains since it hates more of us, are choosing to stay home and figures show while home. we're all watching a lot more tv than we used to. but i'll tell you what we haven't been watching. see . and then in the past the, the channels ratings have taken, you know, after nautical 90 percent dive and it was doing so well this time last year. sowhat's changed? well, donald trump, for one love him a low, if in his time in the white house generated an endless supply of contents. and it seems view is just don't find new so interesting with him out of the picture. but cnn has been making plenty of its own headlines, and that's proving quite a turn off to what about the story of the now form? a producer on chris cuomo show who was arrested for child sex trafficking. prosecutors claim in 2020 john griffin, paid in nevada. woman, more than $3000.00 to fly her and her adopted daughter to his home, where the child was molested by the 44 year old. for several years prior to 2020, the defendant solicited young girls including the minor plaintiff for the purpose of knowingly persuading, inducing enticing and cursing them to engage in sexual activity, sexual exploitation, and or sexual trafficking. report say the evidence include drug, video of griffin, under 9 year old girl naked cnn was of course, quick to respond to the scandal,claiming it was unaware of the employees actions aligned that the channels have become quite familiar with after another. now form a producer for the channel, rick salih. b was also revealed to be under criminal investigation for serious allegations involving potential juvenile victims. the case has been assigned to detectives from the child exploitation score of the major crimes bureau project. very test report ledger salih, b solicited nude photo is of a 15 year old girl. and so cnn has fallen so far from its original tagline of the most trusted name in news. now becoming synonymous with a quite different reputation. you can be on cnn, right? yeah, you know what provided or no? yeah. but networks ethics are also in question after being forced to fire primetime star chris cuomo, off the he was sound to be secretly aiding the defense of his m. baffled olderbrother, the former new york governor andrew cuomo, following his sexual harassment allegations while another c, n. n big named dog, lemon faced his own ethic scandal. the anchor was criticized for covering just a small legs trial. after the empire actor testified in court that the host informed him via text message that chicago police did not believe he was a victim of a racist homophobic attack. but then cnn's top talents always have enjoyed pushing the boundaries. jen, you have this, this devil. water moves. yeah, and i mean, we were saying earlier, you and i and viruses, li, democrats on now more likely to watch folks news than cnn. but overall americans trust in the media is diminishing by the day is not just see. and then the view is turning away from, but folks, news on the m s. n, b c are also seeing their ratings shrink with people turning to alternative.commentators like joe rogan, who has millions more listeners than tucker carlson fox news on cnn. and yet, sin and is worried about you, his concerns that without its voice, people will be directionless. cnn's oliver darcy worries people will be directionless without the major media. if people are tuning out what's going on in cable news, they're just, you know, ignoring everything and living their lives. and we're not really getting the information that they need to them. now by carrying russia health authorities, a warning the country might face an unprecedented wave of covert

with him about his resentment of the situation. then you got your codes or no way related to people. getting corona virus, they are an element of coercion, business as a dying. when clients come, they asked the show a q r code. a lot of clients just turn around and leave. and each client is valuable to go. and the long before the pandemic who was not the most customers, but now the situation is even worse, clients are leaving in the business is losing 70 to 80 percent of their income. and soon it will be impossible to save them because we were sympathetic to the measures all last year. but as a result, according to official statistics and st. petersburg alone around $30000.00 small and medium sized businesses went bankrupt. if the introduction of cure codes wasactually helping save lives as beauty, salon, shops and restaurants closed, then i'd be the 1st to sacrifice my business. but these things are not connected in any way. society is becoming divided according to vaccination status. and those who are not vaccinated are being deprived of their rights. your forties have responded heavily to my statements. they've carried out a huge number of checks, handed out fines, and even threatened me with criminal responsibility. but i am not afraid. and i believe that what i am doing is right, freedom is more important than finds. she's in the meanwhile, a bill to introduce a covey pass for public places across russia. that is now under discussion in parliament, the head of the hospital for war veterans maxine cabanas says that the q r code system helps to reduce the risk of virus transmission support. i fully support the government's decision that q r codes are for starters,for the protection of people who go to places where they are checked, this means that you are vaccinated, hence you can go there and have less risk of god forbid being sick and passing it on to someone else or getting a disease, i also fully support those establishments where they are checked myself and my family visited such places many times during the new year, holidays. and there is nothing shameful about sharing your q r code, which simply indicates that you have been vaccinated. i have not seen any cues or negative reactions to people who show q are codes. the un world food programs warning of a synonymy of hunger and afghanistan were half the population struggling just to get food. this went situations being made worse by sanctions and is so bad for some that they have even resorted to selling their organs. i scam math, $2300.00 equals the price of the kidney or how long that will feeda family is unclear. i couldn't go out and beg for money. i was not able to back then i decided to go to the hospital and sell my kidney. so i could at least feed my children or some time a welcome to modern afghanistan, where the organ trade is flourishing. amidst a dire economic crisis, 99 percent of the don't is selling kid needs of the people encountering economic problems and only one percent of donors of the ones who donate that kidney to a family member. it needed to most donors come from poor families and may not be aware of the consequences. plus the deaths won't go away by themselves. most of people leave the country, fearing for their lives, but some also leave in search of jobs. and when those people cannot make it to other countries, they come back home and they have to pay the money they had borrowed for their travel coast. and to do that, they sell their household belongings or sell their kidneys,and some people even decide to sell their children's young. now as dog for the shark, the chaotic us nato withdrawal and the taliban takeover pushed afghanistan into financial chaos. subsequently aggravated when the west froze afghan assets abroad. and when foreign funding was suspended, the un is now launching a $5000000000.00 a de pale. this is a stop get an absolutely essential stock up measure that we are putting in front of the church. richard, without this being funded, there won't be a future. we need this to be done. otherwise they will. they will be slow, there will be suffering for those who have sold their organs. the suffering has already known be there. ah, max of word has become microsoft woke, the name of the word processing program hasn't actually changed, but it does now boast an extra function alongside the spell checker

moment developments as well. this is the weekly an rti nova joke of it. shes been deported from australia. the tennis world number one was forced to leave for a court upheld the decision to revoke his visa over a vaccine issues. he will not miss out on participating in the australian open tournament. he's one for the past 3 years. the australian prime minister has backed the controversial vertical. i welcome the decision to keep our borders strong andkeep australian safe. strong borders are fundamental to the australian way of life, as is the rule of law. our government has always understood this and has been prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity of our borders. daniel, is that it is out. it's a joke about shoulders australian open for sure, even if he was so appeal which is expressed intent not to do all ready. it would be too late for the thought to be open, which as you said, takes pricing and 24 hours. now the decision, all of those 3 judges

including this medical exemptions i think was fairly and what's right for it is cumulative themselves was this kind of procedures pursuing against your courage for the years. i think the decision is scandalous. i'm disappointed and i think it showed how the rule of law functions in some other countries, that is how the rule of law does not function. it is incorrect all to me how wehave to totally opposed court decisions within just a few days. so there have been 11 days of physical and psychological harassment. what i know is that novak is always the 1st one to stand for the players, but none of us stood for him. be strong. rules are rules, they say then lose at their own court. then find a way to cancel his visa anyway. so what rules were they referring to in the 1st place? oh, i forgot election soon. stay strong. we can make 3 takeaways re from this court's decision. 3 peas if you like, politics, principal, and president. it's hard to argue this is anything to do with a, a rational concern of safety. joke of it's susan said being perceived as somebody who's infectious is going to infect people oppose a public health risk. he had, he actually turned out to be the winner. if he were to attend the australian open and actually when as number one, he's or he'll get $3100000.00 us dollars. so he's missing out on a huge potential pay day here. tell us more about the reactions to this will learna paid a joke of it. she's serv. his dreams of winning a 10th australian open 21st grand slam. are our shattered reaction though that we have to give credit has been very polarizing. we've had people saying both, okay, people have made sacrifices. australia has had one below us cobra death rates, partly because of their very strong rules that stringent looked on rules, border policies, rules the rules are, should be no exceptions. here are the people who have said, okay, it's really about following the rules. he has followed the rules for entry. his filled in his forms, his provided evidence of his medical exemption is code infection. is this really about that, or is it personal? and certainly people on the street serve certainly following the 1st court decision . we're very passionate and very angry about the way he's been treated ahknoxville himself has said he's extremely disappointed with this decision, but he is going to respect the court's decision. is going to comply a corporate with the court suddenly, authorities and an return home on, of course, back at home, joker, which as we heard there from the sub in the president has in views. i'm not exactly perhaps as a mortal source, but certainly the perception has been that he has been mistreated. he's been targeting single doubt as a scapegoat to make an example of that spin the sentiment in his home country of serbia. i am revolted and angry because i did not expect they would treat the world's best tennis player like this. he did not deserve this additional and all nobody's going through is the frustration of our entire nation pursued accruals. they had said from the beginning that only vaccinated people can participate, it would be all right, but at one point they tell him one thing, another time, something else. the funny to go, this is pure politics. the issue here are the principles we live for, at least as europeans freedom, fraternity equality or, you know,i think really the somethings up we can. and we can quote why andy murray, he's a step in and said really from the situation. they're all know what us, this is bad for everybody. this is bad for joking. rich, this is bad for tennis, for the viewers had paid good money to see one of the world's top sports dos play and who of course, already returning their tickets. we're seeing mass requests, the refunds are based on what's happened here. and of course bad for the australian government would be all positions saying that they've dilly dally. they've created confusion and control with the, with the rules on the should resign. really. there are no one is in there. sandra joker, which of course heading home are very disappointed. i'm picking up on one of those points. ellis cashmore, author of the book making sense of sport believes the australian government has made joke of which a martyr by deporting this is a manifestly political decision as the world knows. dot morrison has federal elections looming in about 4 months time. and he's been awarded this morningwith a response from the australian public, which seems to endorse the decision of the australian government to deport joker ridge where the thing that the australian government has missed. that it said before alex hall, the immigration minister said, i don't want to make a martyr out of our hero as a joke of it by allowing him to play. but by deporting him by excluding him from the, the total that he's done exactly that because anti vax is around the world now will be looking to juggle rich and saying this guy's been persecuted for. no other reason than the fact that he is exercising his individual liberty, his choice not to be vaccinated and of course he will become a martyr. alex cashmore will after initially winning their appeal in the case when the serbian was released from the detention center r t spoke to novak torque of which father and uncle, who said he had been treated appallingly by cumber. i can say in my name,i personally mean i vacillated, you know, and this is all him, you know, and on the other side, as you know, to his, the. busy corona in december, you know, and the, this is not a medical reason to get the law sign before a judge that she has though, the girl he gets full time at all. and he has under gene lima. he is looking to get blood real, real, really heavy and we are so sorry. we like to australian people, but the southern government did really wrong things to know. number one in the, in the, in the dentist, one of the best force men ever, you know, this is, this is what he said is very fat mika, than usual. you, samuel, i can't describe the feeling. we never thought off on me. the best tennis player in the world would have had to go through this, especially in such a far away land, where he had already proven himself was the best 9 times. it's incredible that thishas happened to him already, but it has happened and it was in no way related to sports. it's all politics, although he didn't deserve the visa refusal in the 1st place. we never had to deal with such politics. neil, our politics is tennis, sonny, of course we expect no fact to win his 21st grandson and his 10th australia knows perfectly simple girls, i mean. okay, moving on now, the kremlin is insisting on a concrete response from the u. s. to its proposed security guarantees, washington sees it will give it in writing next week. it follows in depth talks between russia and nato. older russia said those negotiations highlighted continuing differences with ukraine being the main stumbling block ortiz, charlotte dubin ski has more. how do you solve a problem? like russia? easiest under false weight is for a shot to deescalate it is russia that has to make a start trice,the escalation and diplomacy, or confrontation and consequences that was due from the u. s. a. nato, after they held a ceilings of meetings with their russian counterparts. on the one hand, they repeatedly said that they were there to find solutions on the other. that solution was some have suggested one sided. russia has to make giant strides towards reducing into military presence anyway, mean crane. if there is to be a d escalation of tensions for the russian delegation, the double speak was too much. we are fed up with loose dog ha promises, misinterpretation of what happened, that different forms of negotiations have behind closed doors. we do not trust the other sites. so to see we need iron clad. waterproof bulletproof,the legally binding guarantees not assurances, not safeguards guarantees. russia was also accused of not being serious about finding solutions to ease the frictions as it continued to deny its planning to evade ukraine. moscow say this is for clear proposals before the meetings took place, outlining what assurances it wanted from the west for its own security. that crucially included nato slamming the door on membership to post soviet countries like ukraine . moscow also hate out that meters idea of security did not extend to non members, should indian luck. nato expansion doesn't solve any problems of security. it division lines or that doesn't remove them. so these are the other things to say. nathan lodgement is aggressive, absolutely not true. and nathan launch month has been a cornerstone for the spread of democracy and freedom across europe. moltoregurgitated the line that it is not a threat to russia. moscow didn't agree. the u. s. and nato continued to conquer militarily. the territories of the countries included in the alliance and place offensive weapon systems. there, ema, this directly poses a threat to the interests of the russian federation, was a final stab was made at finding common ground in vienna at the organization. for security and cooperation in europe, i supposedly neutral ground where and fortunately the language from country representatives was anything but it seems reads were risk of war in the always sea area is now greater than ever before. in the last 30 years, the europeans also went down the smear campaign route, following a massive cyber attack and government sites in ukraine. the eas top diplomattinting one can figure out who is behind this strike. the hackers have not yet been identified. and while the west continues to state it is spread democracy in, quote, security to countries. russia's foreign minister disagrees. the west went too far. let's be frank in violation of all international obligations and common sense they chose to escalate this situation. well, you see the west condemns violent actions against civilians. they condemn human rights violations. but when bloody codes are carried out by those who swear their allegiance to the west, the west embraces them. this is what happened with the ukrainian qu. many people died there, including at the hands of provocateurs and his crew was approved by the united states and the europeans just accepted that as fact. and no one is going to investigate the my down atrocities a mammoth week of talks has ended with well, a lot of hot air, no concrete proposals to move things forward. the only thing that they saw eye toeye on really was just how far apart they are and that it talks fail. the consequences could be catastrophic jollity than sky r. t. amsterdam. and just staying with the story, we discussed the possibility of nato's further expansion into former soviet states with a panel of guests ukraine and even georgia. we would not be allowed to become a full fledged member of nato because they have internal divisions within their own countries. and that is stipulated in the atlantic alliance of nato itself. so until those con, frozen conflicts are resolved, and they cannot be admitted as a member. but you have the united states and nato moving nato forces up to up to the black sea area, just opposite and wanting to go into ukraine and actually do military maneuvers with, with ukraine. and as well as georgia and, and providea so called defensive weapons, which easily could become offensive weapons. and this is, this is what moscow sees as a threat. it would be crazy for nato to get ukraine on board. it's a failed state. it is a finding full time and dangerous democracy in the making as the american say. and it could turn into real war effort. ukraine joins later, not because russia would do anything but simply because to hold heads in jeff would do something stupid to be alliance should be responsible and not take anybody. and within the alliance, believe me, several countries and not the small ones don't want ukraine. of course, there is an image that needs to be projected of humanity, but it is not the case. and people realized in europe that it is very dangerous to have ukraine. and if only because of some of the whole hats in the west of thecountry got, hey, russia and i could do anything to stop the war. a british energy provider fund itself, feeling the heat this week over its advice to customers and how to stay warm. it told people to cuddle their pet son to star jumps. it was part of a response to energy bills that are predicted to double this year. are you weighing up, eating all heating is still the predictor to sort of 2000 pounds a year for no more as one of britain's biggest energy suppliers has come up with no one idea. the 10 ways to save on heating cost, not only laira, but get the hot rate going with some starch. i'm. and if that doesn't work, how about a comes in is a cutter with a cat? okay, i don't have a cat, but i do have this guy. another central suggestion is to leave the open door open after cooking, the capital of your kids love and eat a hearty bowl of porridge. and of course, make sure you havea decent pair of socks or slippers. apparently, all these are simple cost effective ways to keep warm this winter. but the company can't be serious, can it? i think they've completely lost the floor on that one. i have to say don't close with, we're not stupid. i are, we are need to try and notes that i eating on really freezing in our, in house because we're trying to get the cost down. you just think my, what else was i today? if that's real advice than the i'd be slightly and salary by are either hopefully by now why with the event that i need to study my energy done, i put an extra jumper on seminar. so yeah, i want to be in solid bio for any other company, but that doesn't say i wouldn't listen. so i would say got fixed on contract. that would suit me. the advice sent to customers comes as many households are extremely worried about rising energy costs. and despite the company apologizing for the ljudge, suggestion politicians have criticize the coal haunted approach. it is lawful and insulting. but then with this government's lack of an energy strategy, you almost expected those comments will be right by people who have to choose between eating and heating. if that's the state of the country we are now and i find it quite depressing. being told to put on a instead of turning on your heating, if you can't afford it, at a time of such difficulty for so many families is plainly offensive. 2022 has already been given the total year of the squeeze of the one since a 2008 financial crash this year. wages will barely quote one of the same time. 7 bill jumped by 50 percent around 2000 pounds when britain's new energy price cap is 2nd april. this means in real time, people actually get a pay cut in the situation in the for the cost of living catastrophe. i think the information we had,the way to use that you could possibly have in business local support from the government. so we've been forced to close our doors. we're only we're trying to close our way back. so we're hope, hotel and everything else. we use quite a lot of electricity and it's hard to find. i am terrified of the impact of businesses in the country. not just me. when i mean small business is struggling . i just have to stop. we pay the bounce back government and supposedly gave us, but we've got to pay them back to all of a sudden and i'm not going to do that. it's time to money and we were in debt anyway from the lock that i now they energy cost to sort of both electricity and gas so sorry, i don't know how we supposed to pay them because we have no income. and she's not alone. in fact, one and 3 people are worried that bills will become totally on affordable this year. and i'm thinking the government to for the bill. labor also piling on the pressure for the government to ditch tax hikes and scrap v a t on feel all together consent to ministers council, the 0 carbon homes program. they bond on show when development, they launch the eco insulation program. they tore it up within one year. they were, you see, you case gosh, storage capacity. i don't one particularly silly moment. the current foreign secretary claims solar panels were risk to domestic food production or all of these decisions that have made this country more dependent on volatile wholesale energy prices than we otherwise would have been right now we know this means as extremely situate, extremely difficult situation to really household, but also risks making archways. the british industry and competitive a talk, a combination of spiking prices, tax hikes looming energy, big bills on the government. a parent reluctance to address these issues mayactually see ridiculous ideas like cuddling pats, how people overcome this. and the upcoming winters become a reality shot. edwards dashti, arte london, stella head calls for boris johnson to resign are mounting after us, the of scandals, the latest of which we'll go through. right. to join me every thursday on the alex salmon show. i'll be speaking to guess of the world of politics, sport business. i'm show business. i'll see you then. mm . oh, cool. so the you in the story didn't the united states talking about human rightstalking about press freedom. if you going to talk the talk, you got a walk, in other words, you've got to be consistent. you, cassandra, on the one hand, we believe press freedom, but on the other hand, we're going to exclude julian massage. and i think the hypocrisy of united states in his choice is what really makes a lot of people really mad about the guy sitting here in australia where people just don't understand them. right. what is the starting citizen which comes down with ah ah, hello again, families of those who died during the you case 1st, kobe walked on,half slammed an apology from forest johnson as an insult. that's off to the prime minister admitted he attended a boozy dawning street bash during the national locked owns the opposition and even some senior tories helping piling pressure on the p. m. calling on him to resign. it was i don't think he can continue. continue to play a minister asking people to follow the rules and guidance of his government. i don't believe she did. when i went into that garden just after 6 on the 20th of may . 2020. i believe implicitly that this was a work event. well may, 2020 was a tough month for britain. much of the country was paralyzed by the 1st national loc done with indoor meetings between high school is strictly prohibited. we spoke to a man who struggled to arrange his father's funeral amid the restrictions. a common difficulty during those times. this is about rules and about who the host appliesto. this become abundantly clear that the prime minister thinks that they don't apply to him at the same time, but i was at my father's funeral. he was taking part in a, bring your own views, part number 10 downing street. my dad's team will be allowed to invite up to 5 people at the geno. say that meant it was just myself and my siblings could attend . there is no physical contracts that we wouldn't want to hug each other. even the vicar holding the ceremony wasn't allowed to shake hands or anything like that. and as soon as the ceremony was over, we all had to go back, came again. they were author issuing fines for people meeting outside people will be fined money for meeting up people being harassed by the police. if they hung around and parks that too long and the ultimate question half of the prime minister is, why does he believe that the rules that he helps create that he made didn't apply to him? johnson stated, excuse sparkeda wave of means online. even major companies like ryan or have been posting mocking images. it's not the 1st party gates scandal involving johnson. at the end of last year, a pictures emerged online, allegedly showing him taking part in several social events at dining street during the 2020 locked leading to yet more pressure on his position. it is so ridiculous that is actually offensive to the press. you see now going to do the decent thing and resign. how stupid does the prime minister think the british people are right now? he's making fools of every single mp exceeded him earlier? well, the prime minister finally do the decent thing. i'm resign oral historian. peace be forced to show him the door. so for once kind of prime us for do the honorable thing and resign 17 april sharing a plunge. got one thing to play,medical should step down. and eventually you can do, you know, as go brazilian play minister. he sorry, because he's being cool, there any most resolve in my judgement and all the evidence that's concerned in the face for the last few months. now, i think it's abundantly clear that bars johnson doesn't have an ounce of self decency. and him, leading by example isn't really key element of thought leadership that is clear and not only this bar a strong, some not have thought more leadership at the moment, but there's no pathway for him to get back. and that's why, for as long as he remains prime minister, i think we're going to stay in a state of limbo in this country and ultimately is pending more people at risk. when you say this, where it's outlined that the government has done everything they could to save lives, the say little weights, these words that they can just hang. and yeah, a messaging throughout has been terrible. the following of that only scientificvoices has been at best patchy, and at worst they've gone against scientific advice. and the result has been nearly about either a $175000.00 dust now, which is deeply upsetting. ah, this week prince andrew, the queen's 2nd song was stripped his military type or say made a high profile of sexual abuse case. he will also no longer be known as his royal highness in any official capacity. it comes after a u. s. judge refused to dismiss a civil law suit from a woman who accuses him of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. buckingham palace released the following statement. with the queen's approval agreement, the duke york's military affiliations on royal patronage is have been returned to the queen. the vehicle continue not to undertake any public duties on defending this case. as a private citizen. the trial in question was given the go ahead on wed and say thecase was filed by virginia defray. she say she was traffic by convicted peter fall, jeffrey epstein and force of sex with the prince wall of epstein's properties. the prince denies all allegations, while the alleged activities involving the duke of your 1st service thrown 2 years ago. back then he gave a lengthy interview to the b, b. c. in which he said he didn't recall meeting his accuser. however, after the interview, the step down from public duties up to now, he'd still been willing to 8 british regiments, including holding a military rank of the iconic granite deer guards. well, some days ago, british army veterans wrote a letter to the queen asking her to strip the prince of all his ranks and titles within the military. former u. k. home office minister norman baker told me he thinks the queen has made the rightness. i think that we're going to have a summer, or a year old in vomiting revelations that under require to provide evidence to theamerican coach, wanted to put him as possible. so that's that of course required. right. to say the legally people are jo proven guilty in this problem. sorry, i didn't, didn't america. and therefore you could argue that could happen in the cold case is you also in your home, the veterans and myself. you have to get him proper, really unjustly. just tasteful to carry on with that he started rolled onto the start removing long as they are within to get to the queen. and daughters are being fighting or anything like that to operate in britain. he simply having what was given to him by the queen taken away. norman baker wrapping up the week in review while we are riding along next with a sight, carolina swap team and the award winning documentary do not resist. it'sa hard hit to the senses.\"\n",

      "\"that's right away with the russian foreign ministry vowels to retaliate against german media outlets in russia. that's after germany is media regulated, lots of broadcast, gone on on the system channel, the the the u. s. need to respond to vs proposed security guarantees is leaks and published by a scottish newspaper. the document rejects which is key to bonds including keeping neighboring ukraine out of the military alliance. and the in you could put the green label on the gas, the nuclear power, even the way for subsidies in tax code. it comes as member states clash over the switch to renewables in the midst of an energy crisis.ah, going to july for my headquarters here in moscow, you're watching our t international. my name is peter scott and welcome to the program. russia has pledged to take action against german media outlets operating in the country. the announcement from the russian foreign ministry came just hours after our sister channel. our cd was blocked by germany's media regulator. the verdict of the german media regulator is an unambiguous signal that russian concerns have been defiantly ignored. this step deprives us of any choice but to start implementing retaliatory measures against german media accredited in russia. as well as internet intermediaries who have arbitrarily and unreasonably deleted the channels accounts from their platforms. we repeatedly pointed out to germany, the unacceptability of exerting politically motivated pressure on the russian mediaoutlet and the inevitability of counter measures. if berlin refused to seek a constructive solution to the problem, it had created with our tv. well, earlier on the accused, the german regulator of suppressing free speech that's after our t d with hits with the full bond, including on online use. the networks production are taking, the regulated the court. i thought it was wrongly named the channels broadcaster ortiz, deputy editor in chief on a bill can gave rose sushi a breakdown of the disputes via a license that was obtained with absolutely all fording european rules and regulations, according to the european convention on transferred to your television, and we are free to broadcast via that license in 30 plus territory across europe. they are saying that our tv productions, which is an entirely independent production company, is actually the tv channel of that broadcast from germany. and there's generally absolutely no broadcasting happening from berlin at all or tod. e. the tv channel is oh, broadcasting right here for moscow in, in fact, there studios are essentially next door to where we're sitting here. and we were here all launching the channel mid december. yet nevertheless, the regulator is asking the production company to start broadcasting, which they are not even doing. and to do it not just on television, but to do it on the all the online platforms, apps, etc, etc. which again, the production has absolutely no control over all of this is centered right here in moscow and the tv broadcasting as well is done from here. what do you think they were afraid of something that we do here at our team? i mean, it definitely seems that there is quite a lot of apprehension about a different voice, like r t or it's being present there, you know, and they are under fire. not just under it from authorities. in, in germany, the youtube channel was taken down within hours of the over the beginning of thebroadcast. that is obviously an american company. and then indeed there was pressure being put on an indicator independence satellite operator. util sat to take us to, to stop broadcasting our feed as well. so it really is a multi pronged attack when one of the comments that you've made regarding this, you say, quote, we will not be removing our feeds or channels voluntarily and encourage all platforms not to be bullied by the media watchdogs, illegitimate minds that does it seem like bullying. yeah, absolutely. and we've seen those done not just with regards to the broadcasting, but various productions have had all of their various partners, bullied, including banking, banking, relationships, other operational relationships for or for the last number of years. and we believe that, you know, the rtp productions position is entirely not just legal and in accordance with all the rules and regulations,but is beyond substantiated. and that we're hoping that the courts are going to see that and side with them. likewise, our tv channels position is entirely legitimate within germany and other european markets, and we will be defending that position. russian foreign ministry spokesman, maria's carver has accused germany of breaching its legal obligations, leaving moscow with no choice but to retaliate. just don't let berlin now say that they weren't offered a way of staying within the international legal framework. we offer that repeatedly and at various levels. we've pointed out solutions to problems that were not created by us. but if germany has steamrolled through its obligations in protecting freedom of speech, then we have no reason to be shy about retaliating with the r t, the saga has been going on for months now basically since day one, our teeth nicky are in, takes a look back now the turbulence events surrounding the channel,the r t d e launch date was an exciting day, but within hours it wasn't just reporting the news. it was the news with the channels live stream deleted from you chip, just a short time off. it went on air, then just days later, there was a finding increasing interference and the channel signal, after it was taken off one of its 2 satellites. after juvenile authorities claimed it didn't have the license needed to operate in the country. but the thing is it doesn't need one having obtained its broadcasting license in serbia, which just like germany is a signatory to the european convention of trans frontier television. the member states of the council of europe and the other states party to the european cultural convention, or reaffirming their commitment to the principles of the free flow of information and ideas in the independence of broadcasters which constitute an indispensable basis for their broadcasting policy. i know about the closure of bank accounts and so on. there's a large number of tactics that using c r t d. cons operates,they're infringing on freedom of speech and that's very bad. but the european regulator is clearly under a different impression. the license must be issued in germany, and the application must also be filed here. first of all, this is a real irritant, and we will take care of it. so what's the reaction from the german government? what it seems they've decided to stay out of the ralph and now although you don't have to dig too far to find the kind of tone being set by some in the ruling coalition, the media authority and youtube rightly pulled the plug on the pirates station have the enemies of democracy and lateral thinkers, this repeated attempt to circumvent european and national laws, underscores the danger of this self proclaimed t v broadcaster requires action at all levels. so could this be the end of the road for the short live channel? well, r t d is already preparing to fight on. earlier we spoke with rock legend rogerwaters, he's of course, the co founder of pink floyd. and he believes germany is seeking a blog alternative viewpoints which challenge the western narrative they want to create and may have a monopoly of media that only expresses the accepted western narrative that comes down to them to those major outlets from the ruling class in western society and in when, in the western countries state, russia today actually provides an alternative view to the bureau that is given by certainly every single american tv network. you cannot watch network tv in the united states because it's all nonsense, every single minute. i don't care if it's fox news or m s m, b,c. it's all made up nonsense. so russia to day which you can watch in the united states and which i do watch russia today. but it gives every appearance, have been much more direct and truthful about the reality of our lives on this globe than folks yours are, m s m, b, c, or any of the other set. certainly. net network television in the usa on the b, b, c. o. i g, b, or channel for any of the stations as well. they would like to shut down, shut down any voice that doesn't necessarily tow the line and agree with big brother on every single issue. down to the last cross t and dotted iron full stop. this is so or, well here,this is 1984 come to life. they're looking in a mirror. when that when they accuse r t a, a being disseminated of disinformation, particularly now with all this nonsense about your grade, they're looking in a mirror cuz that's exactly what they are all during the full text of the confidential u. s. need to respond to russia. security concerns has been the leads the purported documents with published by spanish newspaper, l and alley. my colleagues, neil harvey and stuff you. taylor discussed its contents over the past few weeks, we've seen at the highest diplomatic levels, riley's of accusations, verbal sparring, and that's just what's been happening and public. so we can only imagine what's going on behind closed doors. but now a fresh document leak has offered us a glimpse into what is indeed happening behind those doors. and it's really showed that moscow in washington, alongside nato, a very, very far from reaching any kind of consensus with regards to ukraine, issue,uninsured. well beyond move, not that does seem to be almost a blind unwillingness from the military alliance to recognize any of russia security concerns. now, the spanish language paper open hasn't managed to get it comes on the nato and us response to russia. security proposals now will remember those proposals they were sent back in december. they fence triggered a flurry of fanatic talks and calls, and essentially they requested legal guarantees, restricting for the nato expansion, specifically with regards to ukraine. the document that we're seeing now though, reveals a very blunt response from washington and brussels. and it's in all states should respect the right of other states to choose or change security arrangements and to decide their own future and foreign policy free from outside interference. in this slide, we reaffirm our commitment to nato's open door policy and the article 10 of the washington treaty. we have of course,requested comment from both nato and the us state department. but if we take just this document, it seems that it is an open, a shot case them, they will not compromise. that is despite flat and person warning. but this is a very reckless disregard of russia's concerns. it's not well for help because don't people realize that this could potentially set all nations involved down a very dangerous path of no return associates. just because when you much listen carefully to what i say in ukraine's own doc, try no documents. it is written that they to return crimea, including by military means that is not what they say publicly. imagine for yourself that ukraine and they to members will begin military operations in crimea . what do we do? go to war with the nato block? has anyone thought about that? so the situation is it seems to me both sides refused to budge and fled him a pit and set it there in a slightly different context. but what do we do? what's versus reaction? been to this must have already sent, follow up questions to this document. so clearly there is a desire for continueda dialogue, but most because position on this has been consistent from the beginning. it recognizes, of course, that every single country has the right to determine its own policy and assure its own security thought is not what's being disputed. here the issue is when countries choices have ramifications beyond its borders and actually post a very real physical threat to someone else. and let's just be clear, a potential nato launchpad located in ukraine is just a couple of minutes miss all away from, from russia. so it's essentially, i think, this fear that really underlies russia's concerns, even though you know shows abortion is ignoring our concerns, the u. s. and need to refer to the rights of states to freely choose how to insure the security. but it's not just about giving someone this right. after all, this is only one parts of the well known formula for the indivisibility of security . the 2nd integral part says that one should not allow the strengthening of any onesecurity at the expense of the security of other states. so the wash and liters asking why must we sacrifice our security that someone else can feel safe? that said, it would be remiss if i didn't point out that the document has some encouraging moments. i'm talking about reestablish communication long military channels, reinstating the nature office here in moscow discussing arms control. so reducing missile deployment to ukraine. but if we get to the bottom of it, let's be blunt, according to this document, the west response to an almost existential concern of russia, as we hear you. but we don't care enough to do anything. and this is in fact case closed. we're not gonna discuss it further, but here's a list of much smaller things that we feel that we can give you to protect an image that we are listening and being co operative but do nothing in any way to address your fundamental concerns with that kind of inflexible rhetoric combined, of course, with this ongoing footage of millions of dollars worth of weapons being sent to kiev. it's very difficult even with the best of intentions to see where to movefrom. now. in other news, natural gas, the nuclear power could soon be classed as green energy. in the u, the european commission supports the idea which has been flooded by environmental groups as green washing. all europe correspondent, people, if it takes up the story for a new energy, has been in focus for quite a while with energy prices across year of being through the roof. but what we've seen on wednesday with the e u commission outline their plans to reclassify some natural gas projects and nuclear power projects on green energy investments. what the u commission, hope that this would do is that it would well take a couple of boxes, really one that it would get investment cash flowing into energy projects to get more energy projects off the ground for to supply much needed energy to the european union. countries also that it would help the european union take some ofit or meet some of its climate. all that it's set, the commissioner in charge of these type of things outlined exactly why they've gone down this route. we need to use all the tools that are disposal to achieve climate neutrality. we putting in place strict conditions for their inclusion. they're subject to clear limits and phase out periods. some will use this instrument and others may not. but whoever invests will be certain that the product they're investing in should it contain nuclear or gas. they will know, well not everybody is happy with this, but some will start with those likely to be pretty particularly pleased with they saw france and germany will start with paris and swell from generates just over 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. well, they may well just become one of the greenest countries in the european union if this eventually goes through because of their use of nuclear, it's also likely to be quite well received here in berlin. germany does use anawful lot of gas to generate electricity and awful lot of renewables as well. but gas is seen very much, is the bridging fuel as they try and transfer more and more towards renewables. the gulf stream to gas pipelines, the much talked about that infrastructure project between germany and russia, looking more and more important. should this plan go through and gas ultimately be designated on that green feel? we'll see more or more investment towards gus in and across the european union. i said not everybody was happy though. and heading into this meeting on wednesday, we heard from austria, denmark, sweden, and the netherlands, all saying they didn't want to see gus added to the list. there's also a whole host of environmental groups as well, who say this is essentially just moving the goal posts to fit what you want to hear and what you want to see and amounts to little more than greenwashing. the complimentary delegated act tabled by the european commission sacrifices thescientific integrity of the taxonomy on the walter of fossil gas and nuclear lobbies. firstly, labeling fossil gas is a sustainable activity is completely incompatible with limiting global warming to $1.00 degrees celsius and with the use 2030 climate targets. secondly, even if ignoring the risks of catastrophic nuclear accidents, it is evident that nuclear does not apply to these key principles is it poses significant environmental and social hazards at all stages of its supply chain. while it's still a few hoops to for this to jump through before it could come into force. in fact, there was some questions, put the money out. and again, as the commissioner about potential legal challenges from so member states no confirmation on that other yet. but it does helps to go before the lead is of the 27 members of the european union. once it gets passed there, which it looks like it will, it goes to the european parliament where more than half of any piece have to vote in favor of it. right now it does seem like it would squeak by us looking atprobably quite a few months though before we see these new rules come into place and we see gas or some gas projects and nuclear power labeled as green energy projects by the european union. i'm just the international has accused israel of unlawful oppression of the palestinian people in what the rights group calls an apartheid. israel has slammed the controversial reports, calling the accusations, anti semitic. the israel considers and treats palestinians as an inferior non jewish racial group. the segregation is conducted in a systematic and highly institutionalized manner intended to oppress and dominate the palestinian people. this libelous document resorts to basis apartheid accusations against israel, among other distortions in so doing the report commits a double injustice. it fuels those anti semites around the world who seek to undermine the only jewish country on earth, while simultaneously cheapening and downplaying the heretic suffering. there wasa result of apartheid in south africa. in publishing this false report, amnesty, you k, use his double standards and demonize ation in order to de, legitimize his row. these are the exact components from which modern anti semitism is made. these very governments as branded amnesty and organisation riddled with racism and then a phobia. israel claims the rights group spreading live similar to those coming from service groups in the region. multiple attempts, the peace talks over the past 25 years have failed to resolve. cor disputes between israel and the contested territories, including the creation of a palestinian state. last year saw a deadly flare of between israel and gaza. it may hundreds of people were killed in an 11 day conflict. we discuss the latest accusations between amnesty international and israel with daniel palmer on to ceo of the news monitoring sites on his reporting and law and policy expert. solomon cycles is no better activations ofanti semitism are designed to distract attention from the distressing and deeply shocking conversion rates in our report on our side in israel, unoccupied. and in territory. this system is enforced through interlock king laws. busy that ensure a fragmentation of the palestinian population that ensure segregation and control of allison in population. and that ensure that land and housing and results of the minds of the population and the most effective strategies for israel, it to, to stop accusations of crimes against humanity in other parts. i'd have to dismantle the them to allow equal right. so kind of stance and jewish israelis throughout all areas. under the crawl,we are indeed calling on international community to take action. those who stand with upon science stand on the wrong side of history are complicit in these crimes against humanity. israel is a place where arab israeli is not only have equal rights under a law, but do everything from serving on the supreme court to being members of the can. i said, which is what we call the parliament. you've got enough air of jude doctors and joe and lawyers to make even a jewish mother proud their actors and athletes. it's like your pilots and police officers. literally everything that is really is do aired. israeli is do so the question of how in the world that amnesty managed to make a report that applied the term apartheid. a situation like this and the answer is on page 37 of the report, amnesty international actually admits that they changed the definition of apartheid in order to make it apply to israel. now when you apply a unique definition,only to one country in the world and that one country just happens to be the world's only jewish state. now i'm not necessarily saying that that's anti semitism, but i'm not sure what else you would call it. and more importantly, you got to ask the moment you can do this to anyone who's going to be next, which vulnerable group will be the next one to be singled out. now for the story we're across today, the head of cnn has resigned for lying about one of the 1st started with a colleague, jeff lucas spent 9 years at the news network, a period of largely falling ratings. his art is kellum open with more, not story. jeff zocker surprised his employees with an e mail this morning announcing that he had been having an affair, consensual affair with an employee, one of his colleagues, and he did not disclose it under cnn's policies. what started out as a friendship, evolved into a romantic relationship and because of that,he is stepping down from cnn. now many looked at his e mail and we're a bit surprised because it seems like many wonder if the ratings and the decreasing ratings over the past 9 years has more to do with it than simply this, this matter of reporting or disclosing a romantic relationship. and at this point, cnn has stepped up and named the successors of jeff zocker, that he will be replaced by a triumvirate of sorts. michael bass, the current vice president of programming amy at, tell us the current vice president of talent and content and can jot the executive vice president of cnn will. all 3 of them together be stepping up to replace jeff soccer and take on his roles at the primary news network in the united states. cnn . back in december, john griffin, a producer at cnn, was arrested by the f. b. i on rather serious charges. he was taken to federalprison where he waits trial. ah, and john griffin was charged with setting up a facility to run interstate commerce for the purpose of learning in young, under age girls and their parents and training these under age girls to be sexually submissive. i mean quite a serious allegation and he's awaiting trial. now this is not a low level employee, john griffin, this is a high ranking producer. this is someone who rubbed shoulders with chris cuomo and you'll recall that chris cuomo also stepped down because it was proven that he was colluding with his brother andrew cuomo when he was facing scandals and eventually stepped down as governor of new york. now there's been another recent dust, kate rosenfeld. cnn commentator kat rosenfeld. she compared jo grogan's audience, so the podcast or joe rogan, who's been at the center of some controversy recently. she compared his audience to people that are overweight and made some other comments that many did not appreciate about the audience of joe rogan. here's what she said. here's people whoyou know. they like something that we consider ourselves more enlightened. don't think it's good for them. you know, we think that they're internalizing this misinformation that they're using it to make bad decisions. now, many found these remarks to be somewhat ironic because the listenership and viewership of joe rogan's podcast is roughly 11000000 people regularly, 11000000 people. listen to what joe rogan has to say. now it's important to know that the viewership of cnn has been significantly decreasing. last year. in the 1st week of january, viewership of cnn was 2700000. but now in the 1st week of this year, it was only $548000.00 and many have looked on at this. and they've noticed that trust for mainstream media in the united states is certainly declining according to polls. and now i guess we see that jeff zocker, after 9 years the head of cnn is stepping down not good times for cnn,and for american mainstream media. if cnn was a patient and a hospital, the doctor would call a co, the doctor will look at his watch or say, call it, that's it. they put the sheet over the patient. cnn is gone. many people expect expect to be fairness. many people believe that c, n n owes them a duty of fairness. people will say, this isn't fair. cnn, the journalist, they're supposed to be journalist, this isn't fair. how can you say this? how can you get away with this? how can they do this? first, this is a my, her again, media where you can say anything you want kind of, number 2, dare dying. they have nothing to lose. their hoping. somebody notices that if, if they were to exhibit unfairness and non journalistic tendencies, you know,what would happen to them? nothing. are there any independent sources for journalistic review? no. well, that's how the world's looking in the early hours here in the russian capital. my name is peter scott and thank you for your company. mm bring you the very latest every out the day. this is our national phone. everyone here witha digital smart city is a city that's using technology to make people's life easier to have beer, collecting a lot of data to try to improve the way things are in theory. these big organizations that are amalgamating and pulling all that data together. they're not looking at you as an individual, necessarily people's data being collected or so much data that there's a real possibility of privacy violation. and that's something most of us wouldn't want to wells transparent. we must live with permanent surveillance. ah, the word eminent will now be scratched from the white house, a rhetoric when referring to the actions of russia, ukraine. but at the same time, a $3008.00. u. s. troops are being deployed to romania, poland in germany, and it seems only one country's liter seems to be publicly standing with the bibleministrations plan of action and ukraine. but it is more about distracting from his own problems at home. well, we're joined by our team to actually retain z to discuss why the u. k. prime minister boris johnson is in hot water. and if this is affecting his foreign policy, decisions in a 4th country is completely a lifting coven restrictions, while others still find themselves in lockdown. should there have been a better global policy regarding coded? from the very beginning, we will ask a policy expert and a total shock today coming from a major news network. well, at least according to their media reporter. as you said, case workers been a larger than life figure as this is organization for nearly a decade of pioneering figure. and now his resignation is stunning. this newsroom.\"\n",
